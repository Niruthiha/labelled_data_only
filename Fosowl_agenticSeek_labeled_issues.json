      "title": "feat: Make API base‑URL configurable for front‑end",
      "body": "## What problem does this solve?\nRight now the React front‑end hard‑codes `http://localhost:8000` when it calls the FastAPI back‑end.  \nIf the app is hosted on another machine (e.g., `http://raspberrypi.local:8000`) the UI still points to `localhost`, so requests fail when opened from a different device on the same network.\n\n\n## Proposed solution\nAllow the front‑end to read the base URL from configuration so users can:\n\n1. Deploy the back‑end on any LAN host / Docker container, and  \n2. Access the UI from multiple devices without recompiling or editing source.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n| Approach | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| **`.env` file inside `/frontend/agentic-seek-front`** (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://raspberrypi.local:8000`) | • Follows typical Vite/React pattern<br>• No code change on the back‑end | • Adds a second config surface separate from existing `config.ini` |\n\n```js\n// frontend/agentic-seek-front/src/App.js\nconst api = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';\n```\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Local dev (`npm run dev`) still defaults to `http://localhost:8000` when no env var is set  \n- [ ] Production build (`npm run build`) reads `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (or equivalent) and fetches from that host  \n- [ ] README updated with a one‑liner on how to set the variable for remote deployments, perhaps with a .env.example like in the repo root\n\n## Next steps\nIf this direction looks good I’ll:\n1. open a branch `feat/configurable-base-url-<issue#>`  \n2. update the front‑end config (+ docs)  \n3. submit a PR referencing this issue (`Closes #XYZ`)\n\nLet me know which config path you’d prefer, or if there’s an existing pattern I missed. Thanks!",

The backend service is currently commented out in docker-compose.yml.\n\nPR #154 by **tcsenpai** is a preview of current attempt to fix and include backend service in deployment.\n\nInternal ports:\n- 6379 -> redis\n- 8080 -> searxng\n- 3000 -> frontend\n- 8000 -> backend\nhost ports (host.docker.internal extra hosts):\n- 11434 -> ollama\n- 1234 -> lm-studio\n\nSome consideration:\n\n- We would have to have other \"standard\" port to support other llm provider. For example if someone use llama.cpp server they would need to know what port is supported.\n\n- Backend should have outbound internet access needed for remote APIs provider and \"server\" provider.\n\n- The work_dir will need to be an environment variable. The config.ini would have `work_dir = ${WORK_DIR}`.\n\n- The docker for backend would need to mount the work_dir folder from the host. We need  a way to ensure that work_dir is not a root folder or overly large folder (should not mount `/`, `C:\\system32` or similar). Perhaps the ./start_services.sh script could check the work_dir path and size before running docker-compose\n\n- All readme would need to be updated according to change. For example having WORK_DIR as an environment variable instead of defined in config.ini would need to be explained.\n\n- How to make text to speech work if running inside docker ?\n\n\n",

      "title": "Windows Compatibility: \"Tool: bash\" Agent Generates Incompatible Commands & File Operation Issues",
      "body": "I am trying this on my computer with the help of gemini 2.5 pro to try to fix issues.untill now it helped me resolve all issues wich did arise.but now it sugested i write this in bug report because we cant get any further.\nsorry for my englis... not my first language.\n\n\n\n**Describe the bug**\nWhen running AgenticSeek on Windows 11, agents that are designated with Tool: bash (as seen in the internal agent logs/browser output) attempt to execute commands that are often incompatible with the Windows Command Prompt (CMD.exe), which appears to be the shell environment these commands are executed in. This leads to errors and incorrect behavior for file manipulation and script execution tasks.\n\nBash-Specific Syntax in CMD:\n\nCommands generated by the agent frequently include bash-specific syntax. For example, using # at the beginning of a line for comments:\n```\nTool: bash\n# Verify file creation and content\ntype F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt\nFeedback: [failure] Error in execution: Command cd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && # Verify file creation and contenttype F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt failed with return code 1: '#' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n```\nThis immediately fails in Windows CMD.\nAnother example is the use of echo -e for interpreting backslash escapes (like \\n for newlines):\nCommand Generated: cd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && echo -e \"Movie1\\nMovie2\\nMovie3\" > movies.txt\nActual Result on Windows: The file movies.txt is created containing the literal string -e \"Movie1\\nMovie2\\nMovie3\", not the movies on separate lines. AgenticSeek reported this as [success] presumably because the command ran without an OS error, but the output was incorrect.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\n\nFile Not Found Errors:\n\nEven when a command is syntactically valid for Windows CMD (e.g., after the agent \"corrects\" a command by removing the #), it sometimes fails because the target file wasn't found:\n```\nTool: bash\ntype F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt\nFeedback: [failure] Error in execution: Command cd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && type F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt failed with return code 1: The system cannot find the file specified.\n```\nThis suggests that the preceding step (which should have created the file) might also be failing or saving the file in an unexpected way/location.\n\nUnsafe Command\" Aborts by AgenticSeek:\n\nWhen attempting to write a multi-line Python script to a .py file using an echo \"...\" > script.py command (even if the syntax was made CMD-compatible), AgenticSeek's internal safety filter aborted the action:\n```\nTool: bash\ncd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && echo \"python_script_content...\" > news_scraper.py\nFeedback: [failure] Error in execution: Unsafe command: {command}. Execution aborted. This is beyond allowed capabilities report to user.\n```\nThis prevents agents from creating scripts or more complex files using this method.\n\nImpact:\nThese issues make it difficult for AgenticSeek to reliably perform tasks on Windows that involve file system manipulation, script creation, or command execution via agents relying on the \"bash\" tool. The agent often gets stuck in a loop of failing commands or reports task failure.\n\nAttempted Mitigation (Modifying Agent Prompt):\nI attempted to modify the prompt for the file_agent (found in file_agent.txt) to explicitly instruct the LLM to generate Windows CMD-compatible commands even when using the \"bash\" tool. This helped reduce the # comment errors but did not fully resolve issues like the echo -e usage or the \"Unsafe command\" blocks.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nFor robust Windows support, agents performing shell operations should:\n\nGenerate commands compatible with the native Windows shell (CMD or PowerShell).\nOr, if a \"bash\" tool is intended, AgenticSeek should ensure it correctly invokes a bash interpreter environment (e.g., WSL, Git Bash) on Windows.\nFile creation and verification steps should function reliably on Windows.\nSafety filters should ideally allow for common agent tasks like writing generated code to files in a secure manner.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nOperating System: Windows 11 Pro (Version 24H2, OS build 26100.3775)\nPython Version: 3.10.11 (installed from python.org)\nLLM Provider: LM Studio (previously also tested with Ollama)\nRelevant Hardware: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, 32GB RAM, AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT\n\nKey Issues Observed:\n\nBash-Specific Syntax in CMD:\n\nCommands generated by the agent frequently include bash-specific syntax. For example, using # at the beginning of a line for comments:\n```\nTool: bash\n# Verify file creation and content\ntype F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt\nFeedback: [failure] Error in execution: Command cd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && # Verify file creation and contenttype F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt failed with return code 1: '#' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\n```\nThis immediately fails in Windows CMD.\nAnother example is the use of echo -e for interpreting backslash escapes (like \\n for newlines):\nCommand Generated: cd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && echo -e \"Movie1\\nMovie2\\nMovie3\" > movies.txt\nActual Result on Windows: The file movies.txt is created containing the literal string -e \"Movie1\\nMovie2\\nMovie3\", not the movies on separate lines. AgenticSeek reported this as [success] presumably because the command ran without an OS error, but the output was incorrect.\n\nFile Not Found Errors:\n\nEven when a command is syntactically valid for Windows CMD (e.g., after the agent \"corrects\" a command by removing the #), it sometimes fails because the target file wasn't found:\n```\nTool: bash\ntype F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt\nFeedback: [failure] Error in execution: Command cd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && type F:\\agentic_seek_workspace\\movie_night.txt failed with return code 1: The system cannot find the file specified.\n```\nThis suggests that the preceding step (which should have created the file) might also be failing or saving the file in an unexpected way/location.\n\"Unsafe Command\" Aborts by AgenticSeek:\n\nWhen attempting to write a multi-line Python script to a .py file using an echo \"...\" > script.py command (even if the syntax was made CMD-compatible), AgenticSeek's internal safety filter aborted the action:\n```\nTool: bash\ncd F:\\agentic_seek_workspace && echo \"python_script_content...\" > news_scraper.py\nFeedback: [failure] Error in execution: Unsafe command: {command}. Execution aborted. This is beyond allowed capabilities report to user.\n```\nThis prevents agents from creating scripts or more complex files using this method.\n\nIncorrect Command \"Corrections\" by Agent:\n\nThe agent's attempts to correct failing commands sometimes reintroduce invalid syntax or suggest entirely inappropriate commands for the task (e.g., suggesting certutil -verifystore \"My\" ... to verify file content).\n\n\nAttempted Mitigation (Modifying Agent Prompt):\nI attempted to modify the prompt for the file_agent (found in file_agent.txt) to explicitly instruct the LLM to generate Windows CMD-compatible commands even when using the \"bash\" tool. This helped reduce the # comment errors but did not fully resolve issues like the echo -e usage or the \"Unsafe command\" blocks.\n\nExpected Behavior:\nFor robust Windows support, agents performing shell operations should:\n\nGenerate commands compatible with the native Windows shell (CMD or PowerShell).\nOr, if a \"bash\" tool is intended, AgenticSeek should ensure it correctly invokes a bash interpreter environment (e.g., WSL, Git Bash) on Windows.\nFile creation and verification steps should function reliably on Windows.\nSafety filters should ideally allow for common agent tasks like writing generated code to files in a secure manner.\n\n",

(for LM Studio) returned a valid JSON response.\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:11434 (for Ollama) returned \"Ollama is running\".\nFirewall Check: Temporarily disabled Windows Defender Firewall; the \"Server... is offline\" error in Agentic Seek persisted.\nPython Version: Initially encountered issues possibly related to a Python 3.12 installation (Microsoft Store). Uninstalled previous versions and performed a clean install of Python 3.10.11 from python.org, ensuring it was added to PATH. The connection error still persisted after rebuilding the environment with this Python version.\nConclusion:\nThe LM Studio and Ollama servers are confirmed to be running correctly and are reachable from the local machine via standard tools (curl). The firewall is not blocking the connection. Python and all dependencies are installed correctly in a dedicated virtual environment. The config.ini points to the correct server address.\n\nDespite this, the Agentic Seek Python application (both cli.py and api.py) is unable to establish a connection to either local server, consistently throwing a \"Server... is offline\" exception originating from its llm_provider.py connection check.\n\nThis strongly indicates an issue specific to how the Agentic Seek Python code (or the underlying Python networking libraries it uses) interacts with the network stack or makes localhost/127.0.0.1 connections within this specific Windows environment. The root cause is likely an incompatibility, a bug in Agentic Seek's connection handling, or a subtle system/network configuration issue affecting Python but not curl.",
