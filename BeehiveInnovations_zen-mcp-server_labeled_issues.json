      "body": "### Project Version\n\nlatest\n\n### Bug Description\n\nI notice zen get's stuck at a chat. There are times when I start a job at night and ping it through another script at an interval so that claude code keeps on working all night. \nBut then when I wake up I have noticed it being stuck.\n\nClaude's recommendation(pasting it)\n\nYou're absolutely right! Zen should automatically recover from being stuck - you shouldn't need to monitor it. If\n  it's hanging indefinitely, that's a bug in the timeout/recovery mechanism.\n\n  What SHOULD Happen (Automatic Recovery)\n\n  1. HTTP Timeouts Should Kick In:\n  - After 15-30 minutes, HTTP client should timeout\n  - Tool should return with error message: \"Request timed out after X minutes\"\n  - You get control back in Claude CLI\n\n  2. Retry Logic Should Exhaust:\n  - 4 retry attempts with progressive delays (1s, 3s, 5s, 8s)\n  - After final retry fails, tool returns error\n  - No infinite hanging\n\n  3. Clean Error Messages:\n  Error: Zen chat tool timed out after 30 minutes.\n  The model may be experiencing high load or processing a complex request.\n  You can try again or use a different model.\n\n  What's ACTUALLY Happening (The Bug)\n\n  If zen is getting \"stuck forever\" instead of timing out, one of these is broken:\n\n  1. HTTP Client Not Respecting Timeouts\n  - OpenAI client may have internal connection pooling issues\n  - Connections stuck in ESTABLISHED state indefinitely\n\n  2. Asyncio Event Loop Issues\n  - MCP server event loop may be blocking somewhere\n  - Timeout handlers not being called\n\n  3. Model Provider Issues\n  - Some providers may not respect HTTP timeouts properly\n  - Streaming responses that never complete\n\n  Diagnostic: What's Actually Stuck?\n\n  Check if timeouts are working:\n  Test with a simple zen chat that should timeout quickly\n  Set artificially low timeout to test the mechanism\n\n  Check server responsiveness during \"stuck\" state:\n  If zen chat is stuck, can other tools still work?\n  Try: zen listmodels (should be instant)\n  If other tools work, it's a specific chat tool issue\n  If nothing works, it's a server-wide hang\n\n  The Fix: Implement Proper Timeout Enforcement\n\n  1. Add Tool-Level Timeouts:\n  # In tools/chat.py - add maximum execution time\n  async def execute_with_timeout(self, request, timeout_minutes=30):\n      try:\n          return await asyncio.wait_for(\n              self.execute(request),\n              timeout=timeout_minutes * 60\n          )\n      except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n          return ToolOutput(\n              success=False,\n              content=\"Tool execution timed out after {timeout_minutes} minutes\"\n          )\n\n  2. Add Heartbeat Monitoring:\n  # Tool should log progress every 5 minutes during long operations\n  # If no heartbeat for 10 minutes, consider it stuck\n\n  3. Add Circuit Breaker Pattern:\n  # If a model provider fails repeatedly, temporarily disable it\n  # Fall back to alternative providers automatically\n\n  Quick Test\n\n  Try this to see if timeouts are working:\n  # Start a zen chat session\n  # If it gets \"stuck\", wait exactly 30 minutes\n  # It SHOULD timeout and return an error\n  # If it doesn't, the timeout mechanism is broken\n\n  Your expectation is correct - zen should handle long tasks gracefully by either:\n  1. Completing successfully (even if it takes hours)\n  2. Timing out cleanly with a clear error message\n  3. Never hanging indefinitely\n\n  If zen is hanging forever without timeout, that's a fault tolerance bug that needs fixing in the server's timeout\n  handling, not something you should have to monitor.\n\n\n\n### Relevant Log Output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Sanity Checks\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues and this is not a duplicate.\n- [x] I am using `GEMINI_API_KEY`\n- [x] I am using `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n- [x] I am using `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`\n- [x] I am using `CUSTOM_API_URL`",

      "body": "### What problem is this feature trying to solve?\n\nThe maintainer has been working tirelessly to add a bevy of features to make this arguably one of the best AI side cars on the market. Some may wish to express their appreciation financially, especially to motivate continued development (not that there has been any waning effort). \n\nI looked for a button, but couldn’t find one. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI believe GitHub natively supports adding a financial contribution button to your repository. Even if not, they are external service services like Kofi that are purpose built for this. How about one of those?\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAlternatives I’ve considered are buying a Ferrari, but as fun as that would be it wouldn’t contribute to this project that has helped me afford said Ferrari (15 years from now, mind you). \n\n### Feature Category\n\nOther\n\n### Contribution\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a Pull Request to implement this feature.",

Seems to not be working.\n\n`./run-server.sh` successfully creates a `.env` and reads my API keys, but `./run-server.sh -c` doesn't output anything and `claude mcp list` doesn't recognize any servers. I also tried opening a new shell and running `/mcp` within `claude ⁠--debug`, still nothing. \n\n```\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗ ./run-server.sh\n🤖 Zen MCP Server\n================\nVersion: 5.1.0\n\nSetting up Python environment for first time...\n✓ Created .env from .env.example\n✓ Updated .env with OPENAI_API_KEY from environment\n✓ Updated .env with OPENROUTER_API_KEY from environment\n✓ OPENAI_API_KEY configured\n✓ OPENROUTER_API_KEY configured\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗ ./run-server.sh -c\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗ claude mcp list\nNo MCP servers configured.

Seems like they have the same content:\n\n```\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗ git status\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\t.env''\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗ diff .env .env''\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗\n```\n\nAlso I saw the note about only using either the OpenAI/Gemini keys OR the OpenRouter keys so I removed the OpenAI key and still not working:\n\n```\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗ ./run-server.sh\n🤖 Zen MCP Server\n================\nVersion: 5.1.0\n\nSetting up Python environment for first time...\n✓ .env file already exists\n✓ OPENROUTER_API_KEY configured\n➜  zen-mcp-server git:(main) ✗ claude mcp list\nNo MCP servers configured.

      "body": "### What problem is this feature trying to solve?\n\nSo I instructed Claude to review a certain file, and that it should make sure to add all relevant files related to it.\nIt did that. It sent a _huge_ prompt to Gemini Pro, but that's what I want.\n\nThe only issue is: Gemini Pro asked for more files, since some files were missing.\n\nAt this point, it's a bit of a waste of tokens. It's an expensive way for the system just to say files are missing from the prompt.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI see 2 possible solutions (and maybe you already do the first one, but I haven't been able to see this):\n\n1:\nUse prompt caching, so the huge initial message is cached?\nBut then again, most of the time this won't be required, so then the extra cache write cost is not needed\n\n2:\nLet a cheaper model (one we can define in the custom models maybe) perform an analysis of the supplied data for the analysis first? Gemini Flash would probably have been able to say that more files could have been added.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Feature Category\n\nWorkflow improvement\n\n### Contribution\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a Pull Request to implement this feature.",

Pure performance.\n\nI have asked it to verify multiple time over to ensure his output was accurate.\n\nI thought i'd share as it could be insightful for the future.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n1. Response Caching Layer\n\n  Cache complete API responses to avoid expensive re-queries.\n  # In BaseTool.execute()\n  cache_key = f\"{tool}:{model}:{hash(prompt+files)}\"\n  if cached := await redis.get(f\"response:{cache_key}\"):\n      return ToolOutput(\n          status=\"success\",\n          content=cached[\"content\"],\n          metadata={**cached[\"metadata\"], \"cached\": True}\n      )\n\n  2. Progressive Response Hints\n\n  Give Claude status updates without streaming.\n  return ToolOutput(\n      status=\"success\",\n      content=full_response,\n      metadata={\n          \"progress_hints\": [\n              \"Analyzed 15 files\",\n              \"Found 3 critical issues\",\n              \"Generated 45 test cases\"\n          ],\n          \"estimated_tokens\": 15000\n      }\n  )\n\n  3. Smart Response Chunking\n\n  Use existing continuation system for large responses.\n  if len(response) > TOKEN_LIMIT:\n      return ToolOutput(\n          status=\"partial_response\",\n          content=response[:TOKEN_LIMIT],\n          continuation_offer={\n              \"continuation_id\": str(uuid4()),\n              \"note\": \"Response too large. Continue for remaining \n  analysis.\",\n              \"chunks_remaining\": 3\n          }\n      )\n\n  4. Fallback Model Suggestions\n\n  When primary model fails, suggest alternatives.\n  except ModelOverloadedError:\n      return ToolOutput(\n          status=\"error\",\n          content=\"O3-pro is currently overloaded\",\n          metadata={\n              \"fallback_suggestions\": [\n                  {\"model\": \"o3\", \"note\": \"Slightly less capable but \n  available\"},\n                  {\"model\": \"gemini-2.5-pro\", \"note\": \"Alternative with \n  thinking mode\"}\n              ]\n          }\n      )\n\n  5. Cost-Aware Response Metadata\n\n  Track actual API costs per response.\n  metadata={\n      \"model_used\": \"o3-pro\",\n      \"tokens\": {\"prompt\": 5000, \"completion\": 2000},\n      \"estimated_cost\": \"$0.35\",\n      \"session_total_cost\": \"$4.50\"\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Feature Category\n\nPerformance optimization\n\n### Contribution\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a Pull Request to implement this feature.",
