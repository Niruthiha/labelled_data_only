Clone repo - `git clone https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat.git`\n2. Run `env.sh`, leave first and third option default, but in second (where you are asked to specify server ip address) set it to `0.0.0.0`\n3. Start app - `docker compose up -d`\n4. Go to web ui (either localhost or local ip address) and try to log in\n5. Login form won't display properly (see #779 for screenshots)\n\nProblem comes from frontend trying to send api requests to wrong (`0.0.0.0`) address\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThis isn't really problem with the app, but it can be confusing for new users. When they are installing tracecat and want it to listen on all interfaces, its common to set ip address to `0.0.0.0`\nA note of this in documentation or `env.sh` script displaying a warning would be probably enough\n\n**Screenshots**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a5f8ed5-3fd9-465a-8126-8dab19423d6d)\n\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\n- Tracecat version: 0.26.1\n- Docker version: 27.5.1\n- Docker compose version: v2.32.4\n- Browser: Chrome 133.0.6943.127\n\n**Logs**\nNothing important but attaching just in case\n[tracecat_log.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18923933/tracecat_log.txt)",

Also it doesn't seem to be actively maintained...https://github.com/Velocidex/pyvelociraptor/issues/20\r\n\r\n## Suggested fix\r\n~Autogenerate the client from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/v0.73/api/proto/api.proto` directly~\r\n\r\nWe don't have the manpower to maintain our own Velociraptor gRPC client. Just going to make this function sync\r\n\r\n## Other questions\r\nHow should we support gRPC in general? Should there be a separate service that autogenerates all the classes on startup??? Should we maintain separate repos for each client?\r\n",

Sync and import the local registry\n3. Add secrets parameter in @registry.register\n4.

We aim to have a <24 hour turnover for every insufficiently useful error message.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nWe designed the parser from first principles that fits according to parser / complier / arithmetic theory. Therefore existing error messages e.g.\r\n```\r\nFailed to parse expression: Unexpected end-of-input. Expected one of: \\n\\t* IF\\n\\t* OPERATOR\\n\\t* RPAR\\n\\t* COMMA\\n'\r\n```\r\nareoften cryptic and do no provide sufficient next steps / information to the user i.e. good for SWEs / development / unit tests but not great for the end user.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Do an audit of all error messages. Make sure we reraise exceptions with a user friendly explanation of the error.\r\n- Make sure every exception comes with concrete next-steps on how to resolve the issue.\r\n- Next steps must provide concrete examples, links to docs, references to the UI",

      "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe current architecture for actions does not give a way to allow the user to determine what to do when a \"failure\" occurs.  The current design is good enough for 500 errors where the failure is unexpected, but we're using raise_for_status in a lot of places that will fire on 4xx statuses as well.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the Okta API will return a 404 if you perform an action on a user ID that doesn't exist.  I see many situations where you may have a user that doesn't exist in every system, so I would want to _attempt_ to disable a user _if_ they exist, but if that returns a 404, I wouldn't want to completely stop execution and show an error in the workflow status.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSome method of putting control into the user's hands for what to do when a \"failure\" occurs on an action.  Low hanging fruit answer would be to add a bool input to have them specify on the action whether to continue_on_failure or something like that and either swallow the exception and return a different value, or let the exception raise normally and halt execution.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere was discussion of a future feature that would give the user an alternate path to hook to on failure from the action.  I think the issue is determining accurately what a \"failure\" is.  For the Okta example I gave, I would consider a 5xx as a failure, but a 4xx indicates that the action itself was fine, but either the user did not exist, or the user was not in the correct state for the action requested.  You may want to suspend a user that has an alert generated for malware activity, but maybe the user is already suspended in Okta.  The current architecture would terminate the workflow when you attempt that action.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\nIf you have multiple of a specific system that you manage, you can't distinguish them and provide different secrets.  For example, if I had 2 instances of Okta to manage, I only have 1 secret defined that is tied to the class, not to a specific instance of the class.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of other systems where you configure a connection, give it creds and config, and then when you add those actions to a workflow you specific which connection it's using.\r\n\r\nThere are likely MDRs or MSPs that would be interested in using this that wouldn't be able to manage multiple clients from one instance of Tracecat and would need to run their own multi-tenant setup to separate them.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIf we could instantiate the integration classes and save configuration/secrets against those, it would solve some upcoming issues as the project grows:\r\n- More integrations means more configuration items, and right now those are managed through environment variables, that file is going to get longer and will likely contain many placeholders for solutions that every user does not need\r\n- Juggling multiple instances of the same integration, i.e. if I had 2 Okta tenants or 2 M365 tenants to manage, I need to be able to differentiate between them both for secrets as well as configuration.  Even customers with a single instance of each product now could encounter this during M&A activities where you typically can't merge tenants on Day 1\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere isn't really a good alternate solution to the above problem.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A",

(Webhook trigger) Open case and Slack notify if malicious email is opened\n4. Run detection on past emails given signal from SIEM, IdP, or EDR\n\nThe Sublime platform API has multiple abstractions:\n- [BinExplode](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/postscan-1): API to upload and explode binary in Sublime\n- [Enrichment](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/linkanalysisevaluate-1): not really enrichment? It's actually a custom deployment of [Phishpedia](https://github.com/lindsey98/Phishpedia): a deep learning [classifier](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/enrichment-functions#machine-learning-functions) for benign / malicious webpages\n- [Lists](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/getlists-1): this is really great. Sublime curates important lists of data from:\n  - [**Email tenants**](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/lists#email-tenant-lists) (Google workspace or M365) synced daily - `$org_domains` and `$org_display_names`\n  - [**Historical context**](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/lists#historical-context-lists) i.e. past communication info specific to the org's email envirornment\n    - `$receipient_domains`: domains anyone in the org has sent (to, cc, bcc) an email to\n    - `$recipient_emails`: emails anyone in the org has sent to\n    - `$sender_domains`: domains anyone in the org has received an email from\n    - `$sender_emails`: emails anyone in the org has received an email from\n  - [**Threat intel**](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/lists#intelligence-lists) curated Abuse.ch lists\n    - URLs from top reporters (URLHaus)\n    - Domains from top reporters (URLHaus)\n    - SH256 hashes from top reporters (MalwareBazaar)\n  - Sublime threat intel\n    - Alexa / Tranco / CISCO top 1 million domains\n    - Disposable email proiders\n    - Common archive file extensions, which can be used to deliver malicious files.\n    - File extensions of macro-supported documents, such as Microsoft Office files. Also includes file types that can load macros indirectly, eg via remote template injection.\n    - Free email providers\n    - Free file hosts\n    - Free subdomain hosts\n    - Top 1 million domains with the most referring subnets\n    - Suspicious top level domains\n    - URL shorteners\n - [Message Groups](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/huntmessagegroups-1): API to analyze hunt and control groups of messages\n - [Messages](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/analyzemessage): API to analyze and CRUD emails (and associated data e.g. attachments)\n   - [Analyze raw message](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/analyzemessage)\n   - [Trash message](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/trashmessage-1)\n   - And more...\n - [Rules](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/listrules-1): CRUD MQL detection rules\n - [User reports](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/reference/listuserreports): org user reported emails\n\nAlso [Webhooks](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/webhooks)\n\n> A webhook Action sends a notification to a URL of your choosing when one or more Rules with the Action flag an email message. The HTTP notification includes information about the message, the mailbox, the flagged Rules, and any triggered Actions, so you can set up an unlimited variety of integrations in response to flagged message events.\n> \n> Here is some of what you can do with webhooks:\n> \n> Send Flagged Message events to your SIEM for analytics or to correlate with events from other tools, such as your EDR\n> Send Flagged Message events to your SOAR, to trigger sophisticated DFIR workflows that are today only used on reported phish\n\n**MQL notes**\n- File format: https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/yaml-files (note overloaded term \"source\" also refers to raw MQL)\n- Two types of MQL rules:\n  - [Detection Rules](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/detection-rules) run on live email flow and are used for phishing detection, DLP, and policy enforcement.\n  - [Triage Rules](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/triage-rules) run on reported messages flagged messages and are used to automatically triage and remediate user reports.\n\n**Implementation details**\n- Non-exhaustive support. Match support provided in official [Python Sublime package](https://github.com/sublime-security/sublime-cli/tree/master/src/sublime)\n- Also support URLHaus and MalwareHaus lists\n\n**Tests**\n- We need the swagger specs. Mock each endpoint + response using `respx` as opposed to testing in a live environment\n- It'll be too cumbersome to build a test lab. Better to use swagger specs as a source of truth and not test live until the Sublime API is more stable.",

Supabase looks for url and key, and posthog fails to initialize.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nOverwrite the docker entrypoint command for frontend/Dockerfile (either in the dockerfile or in docker-compose.prod.yaml) to use `pnpm start`, and set NODE_ENV=\"production\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should run normally and load the app\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWorkaround is to just use `pnpm dev`, even though we're using a multi-stage build and actually building the nextjs project with `pnpm run build`\r\n\r\nI have a draft PR that may help with the posthog issue: #58 , feel free to use this as a starting point.",

Supabase auth primitives are quite low-level and a lot of the authentication logic has to be managed directly by us\r\n3. Handling sessions and middleware is cumbersome\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n- Leverage middleware to decouple auth logic from application logic\r\n  - This means we should only use redirects where necessary\r\n- Use Axios interceptors to apply authentication for all backend requests\r\n- Offload onboarding and new user flow responsibilities to custom Clerk `publicMetadata` for each user, and handled within a `/onboarding` component\r\n\r\n# Tasks\r\n- [x] Migrate sign in/up page\r\n  - [x] Replaced these with Clerk builtins\r\n- [x] Migrate `middleware.ts`\r\n- [x] Migrate all `supabase.auth` usage to Clerk alternative\r\n- [x] Update onboarding flow (creating first workflow) to use Clerk onboarding middleware\r\n- [x] Update FastAPI backend\r\n  - [x] Update fastapi auth dependencies?\r\n  - [x] How to handle authing sessions\r\n  - [x] [v0] No need to replace Supabase as a DB provider, but decouple Supabase dependency\r\n  - [ ] [v1] Replace supabase with generic postgres\r\n- [x] Allow passing of `TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH` build flag to disable auth\r\n  - [x] This works nicely because we've centralized (almost) all auth logic into the Axios interceptor. We can conditionally apply the authenticated interceptor at application startup.\r\n  - [x] Update backend to change authentication strategy based on `TRACECAT__DISABLE_AUTH` flag",

      "body": "# Problem\nAfter we moved the frontend into the docker compose stack, its networking changes. What used to happen was when we deployed using pnpm on the host machine, both the NextJS client and server resolve `localhost` as the host machine. Now, when served from within the docker compose stack, the NextJS client (in the host machine browser) resolves `localhost` as the host machine, whereas the server (running inside a docker container) resolves `localhost` as the container's IP address inside the docker network.\n\n# Solutions\n1. Point all networking environment variables to `http://host.docker.internal:<PORT>`, and in the host machine's /etc/hosts file add `127.0.0.1 to host.docker.internal`. This allows both the host machine and docker containers to reference the host machine using `host.docker.internal`.\n2. Determine if the runtime environment is on the client or server, then use `host.docker.internal` for calls from *within* the docker container/network, and `localhost` for calls from *outside* -- so on the host machine. The outcome is that both domains resolve to the same host.  ",
