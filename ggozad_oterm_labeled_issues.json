      "body": "Have you read the [documentation](https://ggozad.github.io/oterm/)?\n\nYes. I have a nagging suspicion that this note from the documentation might have something to do with it, but I'm, not sure:\n\n> When thinking is enabled you will observe the model thinking while generating its response. \n> The thinking process is not persisted in the database in order to save context, so you will not see it on later sessions.\n\nIt certainly doesn't feel like the intended behavior.\n\nHave you checked [closed issues](https://github.com/ggozad/oterm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)?\n\nYes\n\nAre you running the most [recent version of oterm](https://pypi.org/search/?q=oterm)?\n\nv0.14.0\n\n## The bug\n\nWhen I use a thinking enabled model with thinking turned on, and the model calls a MCP tool as part of it's thinking process, the in progress thought seems to disappear from the context. I'm fairly sure this isn't just a graphical bug. The behavior of the model seems to suggest it doesn't actually have the thoughts in it's context.\n\nThis is a problem when I've instructed the model to complete a task that requires multiple tool calls. It thinks, creates a plan about which tools to call and the order of operations, but then after the first tool call it's as if all it can see is my initial prompt and the result of the first call. At best this causes it to \"re-plan\", but usually it looses the plot completely. This is sometimes quite funny - but not particularly productive.\n\nI'm running:\n- OTerm 0.14.0 under WSL2 in Windows 10\n- Ollama 0.9.0. (running on a remote machine - Linux Mint)\n- Python 3.10.12\n- I'm maining testing with Qwen3:30b and Qwen3:32b.\n\nCheers, and thank you for your hard work.",

I like to use oterm for testing purposes (massively reduced Claude spend lol), it would be nice if we could have support for setting Bearer auth tokens for remote MCP tools (probably just through config?) and then eventually support full OAuth 2.0 client callback flows (we have some experience doing this via [Fief's client library](https://github.com/fief-dev/fief-python/blob/main/fief_client/integrations/cli.py#L180), which is now deprecated 🤕)\n\nWould be willing to help out testing, and can try my hand at implementing the OAuth 2.0 flows when I have time.

It seems to be necessary to use the mouse to scroll up and down through a chat.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to use this program through the full-screen TTY Linux session (via Ctrl+Alt+F5) where using the mouse isn't an option.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make this 100% keyboard-only compatible, by perhaps allowing the use of the PageUp and PageDown keys to scroll through the chat history?\r\n\r\nThanks, and I hope you give this feature a thought!",

That would be a pretty cool feature for oterm to have, in my opinion. No pressure of course - I'm just letting you know of the possibility in case you didn't already.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @gaelj in https://github.com/ggozad/oterm/issues/166#issuecomment-2754000271_\r\n            ",

One moment there was a clear biological signature, faint but distinct, pulsing like a heartbeat from deep within the lunar surface. The next, silence. Nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" she muttered, her brow furrowed in concentration. \"It can't just vanish.\" \r\n\r\nShe ran diagnostics on the probe, checked for interference, anything that could explain the sudden disappearance. But everything was functioning perfectly. The probe was still transmitting, its camera lens clear, but the source of the signal - whatever it was - had simply ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nA chill crept down Stella's spine. This wasn't like a creature retreating into the shadows. It was as if it had never been there at all. A ghost in the machine, a phantom echo of life that left no trace.\r\n\r\nThe scientific part of her mind demanded logic, an explanation. But something deeper, primal and unsettling, whispered doubts. Had she glimpsed something beyond human comprehension? Something ancient and powerful, capable of existing outside the boundaries of time and space? \r\n\r\nStella stared at the blank screen, the cursor blinking mockingly. She had stumbled upon a mystery far greater than anything she could have imagined. And now it was gone, leaving her with more questions than answers.\r\n\r\nThe boredom was replaced by an unsettling unease. The sterile silence of the research station seemed to amplify the whispers in her mind. What had she awakened? And what would happen next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "Enhancement: Refined selection capability",
      "body": "## Human me disclaimer\r\nI want to see a refinement of clipboard copy operation. I wrote a general enhancement description, and refined it through GPT. I think the refined statement is clearer by far that what I wrote, and makes a lot of sense. It follows below:\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThe current user interface supports navigation through tabbing, mouse interactions, and scrolling to access conversation history. A gap exists when interacting with responses containing markdown quoted content, as users cannot selectively copy content within these quotes. This request aims to introduce a capability for users to choose specifically between copying only the content within markdown quotes or the entire response, enhancing interaction precision with the conversation history.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nUsers navigate the user interface using tabbing, mouse clicks, and scrolling, enabling them to select items in the history for copying to the clipboard. In dialog sessions with a mix of responses, including markdown quoted content, the interface does not currently offer an option to copy just the content within these quotes. This limitation affects the process of retrieving specific information from extensive conversations, particularly when the information is embedded in quotes.\r\n\r\n## Enhancement Detail\r\nThe enhancement focuses on allowing users to make a \"sub-select\" or \"recursive select\" within a response that contains markdown quoted content. This added functionality will enable a more detailed level of interaction with the content, allowing users to copy only the content within the markdown quotes to the clipboard based on their selection point:\r\n\r\n- **When a user clicks on a markdown quoted item**, the system will copy only the content within the markdown quotes to the clipboard.\r\n- **When a user clicks outside the markdown quoted area of a response**, the system will copy the entire response, including the markdown quoted content, maintaining the current method of interaction for users needing to copy the response.\r\n\r\n## Assumptions\r\n\r\n- Dialog sessions may be lengthy and include a variety of responses.\r\n- Some responses will contain valuable information within markdown quotes.\r\n- Navigation through the application involves a combination of tabs, arrow keys, and mouse input.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n- **Selective Copy Functionality**\r\n  - The system must enable users to copy content within markdown quotes by clicking on the quoted text, ensuring only the selected quoted content is copied to the clipboard.\r\n- **Full Response Copy Functionality**\r\n  - When clicking outside the markdown quoted text, the system must copy the entire response, including the quoted content, thereby not altering the interaction for copying full responses.\r\n- **Consistency Across Conversations**\r\n  - This feature must work consistently in dialog sessions of any length and complexity, facilitating specific information retrieval without the conversation's extent impacting performance.\r\n- **Integration with Current Navigation Methods**\r\n  - The feature's introduction should not disrupt current navigation practices within the application, ensuring that it complements existing methods like tabbing, arrow keys, and mouse input.\r\n\r\nBy implementing this feature, the application will provide users with enhanced control over the content they wish to extract from the conversation history, particularly useful in dialog sessions rich in specific, quotable information.",

      "body": "Currently to look for earlier chats one can only select from the horizontal tabs above, which is difficult if one have a lot of chats.\r\nI wonder if it is possible to add a page which displays the history of chats and the chat tabs are displayed as vertical tabs (just like in ChatGPT), and I think it can make looking for history a lot more convenient.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and I hope to receive your comments :)",
