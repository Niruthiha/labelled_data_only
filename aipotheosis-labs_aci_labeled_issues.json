Adding support for write functions, especially CREATE_PAGE, is essential to unlock dynamic content creation capabilities.\n\nPurpose: Allow AI agents to create new pages in a specified Notion database.\n\nMarkdown Support: The function should support Markdown-formatted input, which will be saved into the Notion page content (children blocks).",

They can specify in the agent custom instruction for Gmail that this agent can only read any work related emails (e.g. by specifying a list of allowed email senders or a list of disallowed ones).\n\nThis feature allows more granular level of access control than the one provided by OAuth apps. For example, when you allow the scope of read email for Gmail, then the access token can read any email without restriction. With custom instructions, you can specify more granular levels of access control like the example I mentioned above.\n\nIn this issue, we want to add more logging for this feature so we can analyze and further enhance this feature.\n\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd more logging around the custom instructions feature. Please discuss in the issue first before implementing it.",

Daytona provides containerized, reproducible, and scalable environments, making it an ideal backend for AI agent systems that need to execute code safely and consistently.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nIntegrating Daytona.io‚Äôs API would enable AI agents to:\n\n- Create, start, stop, and manage secure code execution environments (workspaces).\n- Upload, edit, and execute files or shell commands in isolated containers.\n- Automate organization tasks like user roles, invitations, and quotas.\n\nThis would support safe, scalable AI-generated code execution, which is ideal for dev assistants, code agents, and sandboxed testing workflows.",

And then they need to find that agent in the agent list, click `Edit Allowed Apps` to configure what apps are allowed to be used by this agent, which is inconvenient.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nI propose that, in the create agent form, we add a table of apps configured for the current project, and then users can just easily check off the apps they want to use this agent when creating the agent. No more extra configuration.",

      "body": "### Required Pre-requisites\n\n- [x] I have read the [Documentation](https://www.aci.dev/docs)\n- [x] I have searched the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci/discussions) that this hasn't been reported yet.\n- [x] Consider asking in [Discussions](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci/discussions) first\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe current MCP servers (both Unified and App) require `--linked-account-owner-id` during startup. \nEven tho ACI.dev is designed to support multi-tenant/multi-user, this compromise was made due to the native support of multi-tenant of MCP (and due to the fact that most mainstream MCP clients like Cursor is not very flexible on what you can pass on to MCP servers).\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nThere are a few workaround we can take to solve this problem, without causing issues to existing users and mainstream MCP clients.\n\n1. (Preferred) We just allow MCP clients/users to pass additional parameters for ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION. Currently the schema only has \"intent\" property and that's what the LLM will generate. But MCP clients/users can do some post processing after getting the tool call decision from LLM and inject \"linked_account_owner_id\" \n\n2. We provide a non standard interface \"set_owner_id(id)\"  (in additional to list_tools(), call_tool()), which your MCP client can call to set the owner id before calling ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION.\n\n3. We provide another meta function ACI_SET_OWNER_ID, which your MCP client can call with the standard call_tool().  But note that your probably want to call this statically/deterministically instead of relying on LLM to generate the function call and it's argument (the owner_id).",
