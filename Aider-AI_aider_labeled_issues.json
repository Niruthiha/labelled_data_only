In such cases, it would be beneficial to manually  exclude these folders or files from the map.\r\n\r\n## Feature Description:\r\n\r\nAdding a feature that allows users to specify directories or files to be excluded from the mapping process. This could be implemented in the form of a configuration setting or command line argument where users can provide a list of directories or files to be ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Benefit:\r\n\r\nThis feature would enable users to better control the mapping process and manage the context that GPT-4 operates in. Ignoring less relevant folders or files would not only speed up the mapping process, but also provide more space for the more relevant and important context.",

      "title": "Multiple Conversation Threads, Prompt Customization, and Conversation Templates",
      "body": "Another feature that could enhance the flexibility and organization of using Aider in complex or multi-faceted projects is the support for multiple conversation threads.\r\n\r\nFeature Request:\r\n\r\nPlease add support for multiple conversation threads in Aider, enabling users to maintain separate discussions or sessions on different aspects of the same repository without interference. This feature could be managed through a --thread command line parameter, which defaults to \"main\" but can be set to other names to switch between independent conversation histories and file selections.\r\n\r\nUse Case:\r\n\r\nIn projects where different components or features require distinct but simultaneous development focus, having the ability to switch contexts within the same repository environment can be invaluable. For example, one might want to discuss database issues in one thread and UI enhancements in another, without mixing the conversations and relevant file edits.\r\n\r\nProposed Implementation:\r\n\r\nIntroduce a --thread parameter that specifies the active conversation thread.\r\n\r\nStore conversation-specific data like .aider.input.history and other session files in thread-specific subdirectories or encode the thread name in the file names. For instance, using an .alder directory at the top level for global configurations, and thread-XXX subdirectories for each conversation thread's data, could help keep project directories organized and avoid clutter, while enabling future extensibility and per-thread customization.\r\n\r\nQuestions for Consideration:\r\n\r\nVersion Control for .alder Files: Is it considered good practice to check in .alder files into the repo to maintain conversation history across different development environments? What are the implications for privacy and clutter in version control, and uses of pre-configured thread templates for particular tasks like chatting about documentation, apis, porting, internationalization, etc. \r\n\r\nCustomizing Prompts per Conversation: Beyond simply including files with instructions, is there a mechanism to customize or augment the built-in AI prompts based on the conversation thread? This could tailor the assistance more closely to the context of each thread. Could there be an /instruct command like /add that adds those files as system prompts instead of user input? \r\n\r\nSaved conversation threads could be used as Conversation Templates that are pre-configured, parameterized, and start private conversation threads that may or may not be ignored and checked into source code control. \r\n\r\nConversation Templates could included pre-configured sets of files, wildcards, or dynamic procedural selections (like dependencies on .h files from selections of .c files, so a conversation about documentation could include all the header files, and a conversation about user interface could include all of the header files and all of the user interface .c files, and user interface api documentation). \r\n\r\nSelecting files per thread could be partially accomplished by threads having their own .alderignore files (including white lists) layered on top of the global repo wide alder white list. But procedure file selection by running shell commands or scripts would also be powerful. Also save and restore named sets of selected files on a per-conversation basis. So three layers of file name globbing + ignoring: repo, conversation thread, named file list. \r\n\r\nThis enhancement would not only make it easier to manage multiple development streams within a single repository but also align Aider with more complex development workflows where multitasking across different components is necessary.\r\n\r\nI would also love a \"/foreach [list of files] [instructions]\" command whose behavior could be specialized in each conversation. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering this feature. I believe it could significantly enhance the practicality of Aider in more complex projects. I look forward to your insights and hopefully seeing this capability in a future release!\r\n\r\nI am excited about the potential for this feature and how it could improve Aider!\r\n\r\nSystem Info:\r\n\r\nAider version: v0.21.2-dev\r\nModel being used: gpt-4-0613\r\nOperating environment: Mac\r\n",

Aider works pretty well out of the box with it (I use `uv tool install aider-chat`), however certain functions I think could work a bit better if Aider had \"an awareness\" of uv being used, for example prompts to upgrade fail. Also execution of resulting generated python code require a prefix of `uv run file.py`, instead of `python file.py`, unless one creates an alias. \r\n\r\nI do realise `uv` seems to break some conventions with regard to how Python files are called conventionally (by requiring a `uv` prefix, even for compatible operations such as `pip install` becomes `uv pip install` etc.) and this may not be something that the Aider maintainers may wish to support explicitly yet.\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\nAider v0.62.0\r\n",

      "title": "Vertex AI models can't use the weak or editor models?",
      "body": "### Issue\n\nUsing the Vertex AI provider/platform/API, we've been getting this series of errors forever, and I think it's causing fallback to the \"big expensive\" model for every operation, which is kinda burning through our free credits really fast (and it's slower, etc).\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nVERTEXAI_PROJECT=XXX VERTEXAI_LOCATION=us-central1 aider --no-gitignore --no-attribute-author --no-attribute-committer --model vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\n```\n\nThe `litellm.BadRequestError` shows up on every operation:\n\n```\nApplied edit to TODO.md\nlitellm.BadRequestError: LLM Provider NOT provided. Pass in the LLM provider you are trying to call. You passed model=vertex_ai-language-models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\n Pass model as E.g. For 'Huggingface' inference endpoints pass in `completion(model='huggingface/starcoder',..)` Learn more: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers\n```\n\nAider suggests this fix to aider and it appears to work for me. Feel free to add it back (I don't know if this is actually the best/correct place for this fix or if it should be fixed at the provider/model name creation elsewhere):\n\n\n## Session\n\nOkay, I will modify aider/models.py to normalize the Vertex AI model names. The change involves checking if the model name contains \"-language-models/\" and starts with   \nvertex_ai, and if so, replacing \"-language-models/\" with / to ensure LiteLLM can correctly parse the provider. This normalization will happen in the Model class          \nconstructor.                                                                                                                                                              \n\nHere is the SEARCH/REPLACE block:                                                                                                                                         \n\n```haskell\naider/models.py                                                                                                                                                           \n<<<<<<< SEARCH                                                                                                                                                            \n        # Map any alias to its canonical name                                                                                                                             \n        model = MODEL_ALIASES.get(model, model)                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n        self.name = model                                                                                                                                                 \n=======                                                                                                                                                                   \n        # Map any alias to its canonical name                                                                                                                             \n        model = MODEL_ALIASES.get(model, model)                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n        # Normalize Vertex AI model names that include \"-language-models/\"                                                                                                \n        if model.startswith(\"vertex_ai\") and \"-language-models/\" in model:                                                                                                \n            model = model.replace(\"-language-models/\", \"/\", 1)                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n        self.name = model                                                                                                                                                 \n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n\n\n### Version and model info (with the above fix)\n\n```haskell\nAider v0.83.3.dev26+g07c5e3d2\nMain model: vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 with diff-fenced edit format\nWeak model: vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\nRepo-map: using 4096 tokens, auto refresh\n```\n\n### Version and model info (without the above fix)\n\n```haskell\nMain model: vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 with diff-fenced edit format\nWeak model: vertex_ai-language-models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\nRepo-map: using 4096 tokens, auto refresh\n```",

      "body": "Is there any plan to make aider capable of performing more of the local file maintenance tasks required during development, of moving and renaming files and folders?\r\n\r\nOr is this the kind of thing best left to a layer like langgraph or autogen with tools that wrap around aider?\r\n\r\nRIght now my experiences go something like this, and sometimes crash when I ask it to move a file.\r\n```\r\n$ aider DESIGN.md\r\nAider v0.27.0\r\nModel: gpt-4-1106-preview using udiff edit format\r\nGit repo: ..\\..\\..\\.git with 32 files\r\nRepo-map: using 1024 tokens\r\nAdded filesystem\\find\\up\\DESIGN.md to the chat.\r\nUse /help to see in-chat commands, run with --help to see cmd line args\r\nNote: in-chat filenames are always relative to the git working dir, not the current working dir.\r\nCur working dir: C:\\Users\\victorb\\code\\ai-sdlc\\filesystem\\find\\up\r\nGit working dir: C:\\Users\\victorb\\code\\ai-sdlc\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\nfilesystem\\find\\up\\DESIGN.md\r\n> Please write a find-up.sh file in the versions\\0.2 folder, according to the features in DESIGN.md\r\n\r\nThis diff represents the creation of a new file `find-up.sh` in the `versions/0.2` directory. The script is a basic implementation of the `find-up` tool as described in the DESIGN.md document. It includes parsing of the new upward search flags, a function to perform the upward search, and the main logic to start the search from the current directory or a provided path.\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllow creation of new file versions/0.2/find-up.sh? y\r\nApplied edit to versions/0.2/find-up.sh\r\nCommit 24a88f8 aider: Create find-up.sh script for upward search functionality in versions/0.2 folder.\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\nversions\\0.2\\find-up.sh filesystem\\find\\up\\DESIGN.md\r\n> Can you move the versions tree from the root to `filesystem\\find\\up\\\r\n\r\nTo move the `versions` tree from the root to `filesystem/find/up/`, you would typically use file system commands like `mv` in a Unix-like environment. However, since you're asking for a diff, I will provide you with a representation of what the changes would look like in a diff format. Please note that actual moving of directories and files is not something that can be represented in a diff because diffs show changes to file contents, not file system operations.\r\n\r\nIf you were to apply this change in a real environment, you would execute a command like this:\r\n```\r\n```sh\r\nmv versions filesystem/find/up/\r\n```\r\n```\r\nHowever, for the sake of this exercise, here's a representation of what the diff might look like if we were to \"move\" the contents of the `find-up.sh` script:\r\n```\r\n```diff\r\n--- versions/0.2/find-up.sh\r\n+++ filesystem/find/up/versions/0.2/find-up.sh\r\n@@ ... @@\r\n # The contents of the file would remain unchanged, but the file's path is updated.\r\n # No actual content diff is provided since the file itself is not being modified, only moved.\r\n```\r\n```\r\nPlease execute the appropriate file system command to move the directory as diffs cannot perform such operations.\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\nversions\\0.2\\find-up.sh filesystem\\find\\up\\DESIGN.md\r\n>\r\n```",

      "body": "# Command-Specific Model Selection for Aider\n\n## Overview\nThis feature request proposes enhancing Aider's model selection capabilities to provide more granular control over which AI models are used for specific commands or operations.\n\n## Background\nAider currently supports three tiers of models:\n- Main model (set via `--model` or `/model` command)\n- Editor model (set via `--editor-model`, typically auto-selected based on main model)\n- Weak model (set via `--weak-model`, used for commit messages and history summarization)\n\nWhile this provides general-purpose model selection, users currently cannot associate specific commands with particular models, requiring either frequent model switching or compromising on model selection.\n\n## Problem Statement\nUsers need the ability to associate specific AI models with particular commands or macros to optimize their workflow. The current general-purpose model selection creates friction when users need different models for different tasks within the same session.\n\nFor example, a user might want to:\n- Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet for code generation\n- Use DeepSeek for troubleshooting\n- Use a lightweight (and fast) model for simple revisions\n\nCurrently, this requires manually switching models with the `/model` command before each operation, which disrupts workflow efficiency.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nImplement command-specific model selection with the following features:\n\n### 1. Command-Model Association\n- Add ability to specify which AI model to use for specific commands or macros\n- Support different models for different command types within the same session\n- Maintain the existing general-purpose model selection capability\n\n### 2. Model Switching Improvements\n- Allow users to switch between different models for the same command type as needed\n- Support dynamic model switching during active sessions without requiring restart\n\n### 3. Operation Concept\n#### New Command Syntax\n```\n/with <model_name> <command> [arguments]\n```\nExample:\n```\n/with deepseek ask Why is this so slow?\n/with sonnet code \"Optimize the search algorithm\"\n/with o3-mini fix spelling errors\n```\nUsing `/with` with no arguments will tie the model (or model alias) with the given command for the rest of the session.",

      "title": "System message configuration issue ",
      "body": "### Issue\n\n# Aider Bug Report: System Message Configuration Issues\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nMultiple attempts to configure aider's system message have failed across different approaches. The configuration appears to be problematic with both YAML configuration and command-line arguments, suggesting a deeper issue with how system messages are handled.\r\n\r\n## Summary of Issues\r\n1. YAML configuration treats system message as a filename\r\n2. Command-line argument for system message is not recognized\r\n3. No clear documentation on the correct way to configure system messages\r\n4. Error messages are not helpful in identifying the correct configuration method\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n### Attempt 1 - YAML Configuration with Inline Message\r\n1. Add to aider.conf.yml:\r\n```yaml\r\nsystem-message: \"You are a pair programmer...\"\r\n```\r\nResult: File name too long error\r\n\r\n### Attempt 2 - YAML with Different Key Format\r\n1. Try different key formats in aider.conf.yml:\r\n```yaml\r\nsystem_message: \"...\"\r\nsystem-message: \"...\"\r\n```\r\nResult: Same file name too long error\r\n\r\n### Attempt 3 - External File Reference in YAML\r\n1. Create system message file (aider.system.txt)\r\n2. Reference in aider.conf.yml:\r\n```yaml\r\nsystem-message-file: aider.system.txt\r\n```\r\nResult: Configuration not recognized\r\n\r\n### Attempt 4 - Direct File Path in YAML\r\n1. Update aider.conf.yml:\r\n```yaml\r\nsystem-message: /home/tom/git/dotfiles/aider.system.txt\r\n```\r\nResult: Treated as literal message text\r\n\r\n### Attempt 5 - Command Line Argument\r\n1. Create a system message file (aider.system.txt) with the desired prompt\r\n2. Create an arguments file (aider.args) containing: `--system-message=/path/to/aider.system.txt`\r\n3. Run aider with: `aider $(cat aider.args)`\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n1. When using YAML configuration with inline message:\r\n```\r\nOSError: [Errno 36] File name too long: 'You are a pair programmer...'\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. When using command line argument:\r\n```\r\naider: error: unrecognized arguments: --system-message=/home/tom/git/dotfiles/aider.system.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. When using system-message-file in YAML:\r\n```\r\nConfiguration key 'system-message-file' not recognized\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Full help output shows no system message configuration options:\r\n```\r\nusage: aider [-h] [--openai-api-key OPENAI_API_KEY]\r\n             [--anthropic-api-key ANTHROPIC_API_KEY] [--model MODEL] [--opus]\r\n             [--sonnet] [--haiku] [--4] [--4o] [--mini] [--4-turbo]\r\n             ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nAider should accept the system message from the specified file and use it to configure the AI assistant's behavior.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- OS: Linux 5.15.0-126-generic (64bit)\r\n- Shell: /bin/bash\r\n- Aider version: v0.65.1\r\n- Main model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\r\n\r\n## Configuration Files and Attempts\r\n\r\n### aider.conf.yml attempts:\r\n1. Initial attempt:\r\n```yaml\r\nmodel: sonnet\r\neditor: vim\r\nanalytics: true\r\nanalytics-log: analytics.log\r\ncache-prompts: true\r\ncache-keepalive-pings: 1\r\nmax-chat-history-tokens: 10000\r\nsystem-message: \"You are a pair programmer...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. File reference attempt:\r\n```yaml\r\nsystem-message: /home/tom/git/dotfiles/aider.system.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Alternative key attempt:\r\n```yaml\r\nsystem_message: \"You are a pair programmer...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### aider.system.txt:\r\nContains the complete system message:\r\n```\r\nYou are a pair programmer that responds to natural language requests...\r\n[Full message content]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### aider.args:\r\nCommand line argument attempt:\r\n```\r\n--system-message=/home/tom/git/dotfiles/aider.system.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Execution Methods Tried:\r\n1. Direct aider execution: `aider`\r\n2. With config file: `aider -c aider.conf.yml`\r\n3. With args file: `aider $(cat aider.args)`\r\n4.

If I explicitly tell it to activate the local virtualenv, it does that and uses it as I'd expect it to, but I'm wondering if there's something wrong I'm doing with aider that is getting me in this situation. I end up doing `/run . ./my_env/bin/activate; pytest tests/` or saying \"activate the my_env virtualenv and install that package.\r\n\r\nIs there a good way to specify the environment that the aider uses in a `/run` command or when it proposes a shell command?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

      "title": "Proposal: Compact code modification format",
      "body": "**Proposal: A New Compact Unified Syntax for Efficient and Precise Code Modifications**\r\n\r\nHello Aider community! I'd like to address some issues with our current code modification system and propose a new, more efficient, and precise solution. Let's start by examining the problems we're facing:\r\n\r\n**Current Issues:**\r\n\r\n1. High Token Consumption:\r\n   - Our current search/replace blocks often contain large portions of code, even when modifying small sections.\r\n   - These tokens are generated by the model, which is costly.\r\n   - Worse yet, these large blocks are resent with each request as part of the conversation, compounding the cost throughout the entire chat session.\r\n\r\n2. Error-Prone Matching:\r\n   - The current system requires an exact match in the search block.\r\n   - Even minor differences in whitespace or formatting can cause the modification to fail.\r\n\r\n3. Context Pollution:\r\n   - Large search/replace blocks clutter the chat context.\r\n   - This can negatively impact the model's performance and lead to confusion in longer sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese issues not only affect the efficiency and reliability of our system but also significantly increase the cost of using Aider, especially for larger projects or longer sessions.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution: Unified Code Modification Syntax**\r\n\r\nTo address these problems, I propose a new, unified syntax for all code modifications. This syntax is designed to be intuitive, flexible, efficient, and capable of handling multi-file projects with precision.\r\n\r\n**The New Syntax:**\r\n```\r\n@file(path/to/file.ext)@location:operation\r\ncontent\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- `file(path/to/file.ext)` specifies the target file\r\n- `location` specifies where in the code we want to make changes\r\n- `operation` specifies what we want to do (`search`, `replace`, `add`, or `delete`)\r\n- `content` is the relevant text for the operation\r\n\r\n**Location Specifiers:**\r\n- Code elements: `function`, `struct`, `method`, `var`, `const`, `import`\r\n- Text matching: `text` (for string-based search and replace)\r\n- File-level operations: Omit the second `@location` for file-level operations\r\n\r\n**Operations:**\r\n- `search`: Identify a section of code (used with `text` location)\r\n- `replace`: Replace the specified code element or matched text\r\n- `add`: Insert new code at the specified location\r\n- `delete`: Remove the specified code element\r\n\r\n**Positioning Modifiers:**\r\nFor `add` operations, you can use `.end`, `.after`, or `.before` to specify the exact insertion point.\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n1. Replace a function in a specific file:\r\n```\r\n@file(src/main.go)@function(calculateTotal):replace\r\nfunc calculateTotal(items []Item) float64 {\r\n    total := 0.0\r\n    for _, item := range items {\r\n        total += item.Price * float64(item.Quantity)\r\n    }\r\n    return total\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Traditional search and replace in a file:\r\n```\r\n@file(src/main.go)@text:search\r\nfmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\r\n@file(src/main.go)@text:replace\r\nfmt.Println(\"Hello, Aider!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add a method to a struct in a specific file:\r\n```\r\n@file(src/models/user.go)@struct(User).end:add\r\nfunc (u *User) IsAdmin() bool {\r\n    return u.Role == \"admin\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Delete a variable declaration from a specific file:\r\n```\r\n@file(src/config/app.go)@var(MaxConnections):delete\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Replace the entire contents of a file:\r\n```\r\n@file(src/main.go):replace\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello, Aider!\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key Benefits:**\r\n\r\n1. Reduced Token Usage: By precisely targeting code elements, we significantly reduce the number of tokens needed for most operations.\r\n2. Improved Accuracy: Using tree-sitter for parsing allows for more accurate code element identification, reducing errors.\r\n3. Cleaner Context: Smaller, more precise modification blocks keep the chat context cleaner.\r\n5. Intuitive and Consistent: The syntax is easy to understand and use, with a consistent structure across all operations.\r\n6. Backward Compatible: Supports traditional string-based search and replace for familiarity and edge cases.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\n\r\nThe system will use a combination of tree-sitter for precise code parsing and string matching for backward compatibility:\r\n\r\n1. Parse the `@file(path)@location:operation` syntax.\r\n2. Identify the target file based on the provided path.\r\n3. For code element locations, use tree-sitter to locate the specified element within the file.\r\n4. For `@text` locations, perform string matching within the specified file.\r\n5. Apply the operation (`search`, `replace`, `add`, `delete`) at the correct position in the correct file.\r\n6. If we fail to find the block using symbol search we can retry using the search/replace as a fallback.\r\n\r\n**Potential Challenges:**\r\n\r\n1. Implementing tree-sitter support for multiple languages.\r\n2. Handling complex nested structures accurately.\r\n3. Balancing the precision of tree-sitter parsing with the flexibility of string matching.\r\n4. Ensuring consistent behavior across different programming languages.\r\n5. Maintaining code formatting and style during modifications.\r\n7. Handling relative vs. absolute file paths.\r\n8. Ensuring file paths are valid and accessible.\r\n",

      "body": "### Issue\n\nSome inspiration could be taken from\r\nhttps://github.com/simonw/llm by Simon Willison, his LLM tool allows the creation of plugins (#1814) . He also has a prompt template system that allows users to save prompt templates. This can be used to interesting effect, for example (note in this example I wrote it out in full without using a template for clarity):\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nllm -s \"Output the keystrokes required to achieve the following task in vim. Answer in as few words as possible. Print the keystrokes, then on a newline print a succinct explanation.\" -m claude-3.5-sonnet \"$*\"\r\n```\r\nI  alias that script to `vh` and then use it like this:\r\n\r\n~$ vh copy line under cursor\r\n>yy\r\n>Yank (copy) the current line\r\n\r\nI think that custom commands would be handy for aider, for example when using aider as interactive help for itself, the following command would be handy to check what's new in aider:\r\n\r\n`/run git log --since=\"1 month ago\" --pretty=format:\"%h - %s\" --grep=\"feature\\|add\\|new\"`\r\n\r\nit would be handy to save things like that, but they're probably not worthy of a plugin - therefore ability to save them as a template would be handy.\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

Since i don't know what url is called by litellm, this might be a temporary http server issue unrelated to aider (My network connection to common servers is fine). The general goal of limiting unnecessary http calls that might slow down aiders startup is still valid.\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider: v0.73.0",

      "body": "### Issue\n\naider v0.70.0\nCmd: `aider --sonnet --verbose`\n\nI noticed while running in verbose mode that aider was receiving responses containing *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks, which were not being written to the filesystem even though they appear to be formatted correctly. Both times I saw this behavior, the LLM response didn't end until it asked to add another file in the chat. At that point, aider prompted me to add files to the chat but the edits were never written to disk.\n\nBelow is a snippet from the second time it happened to me.\n\n```\nASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.\n\nUSER Let's work on the chat command and chat panel files\n\nUSER I added these files to the chat: src/commands/chat.ts, src/panels/chatPanel.ts\n...\n...<omitted for brevity>\n...\nUSER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\nUSER \nUSER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:\nUSER \nUSER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.\nUSER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.\nUSER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.\nUSER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.\nUSER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.\nUSER - Etc.\nUSER \nI'll help implement the chat functionality based on the implementation plan. We'll need to:\n\n1. Create the ChatPanel class to handle the UI\n2. Implement the chat commands\n3. Wire everything together\n\nHere are the changes:\n\nsrc/panels/chatPanel.ts\n<source>typescript\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode'\nimport { LLMProvider } from '../providers/types'\nimport { Message } from '../providers/types'\n\nexport class ChatPanel {\n    ...<omitted for brevity>\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</source>\n\nsrc/commands/chat.ts\n<source>typescript\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode'\nimport { LLMProvider } from '../providers/types'\nimport { ChatPanel } from '../panels/chatPanel'\n\nexport function registerChatCommands(\n        context: vscode.ExtensionContext,\n        provider: LLMProvider\n) {\n        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand(\n                'multi-llm-assistant.openChat',\n                () => {\n                        ChatPanel.createOrShow(provider)\n                }\n        )\n\n        context.subscriptions.push(disposable)\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</source>\n\nThese changes implement:\n1. A ChatPanel class that manages a webview-based chat interface\n2. Basic chat UI with message history and input field\n3. Command registration to open the chat panel\n4. Message handling between the webview and extension\n\nThe chat interface supports:\n- Sending messages with Send button or Enter key\n- Scrollable message history\n- Error handling for failed requests\n- Persistent panel state\n\nYou'll need to add the command to package.json. Would you like me to help with that?\nTokens: 4.9k sent, 1.3k received. Cost: $0.03 message, $0.08 session.\nAdd package.json to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]:\n```\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

This very quickly overflows the size of the repo map and makes aider unable to discover much about the project, at least on my local setup.\n\nIf I put the following JS file into an empty git project:\n```\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log(1, 2);\n}\nfunction bar() {\n  console.log(3, 4);\n}\nfunction baz() {\n  console.log(5, 6);\n}\n```\n\nThen I run `aider --show-repo-map`, I see this:\n\n```\ntest.js:\n│function foo() {\n⋮\n│function bar() {\n│  console.log(3, 4);\n│}\n│function baz() {\n│  console.log(5, 6);\n⋮\n```\n\nI have found that hacking the constructor to `TreeContext` to include `parent_context=False` as well as the existing `child_context=False` in `aider/repomap.py` makes it work as I would expect. After applying this hack, I see the following repo map instead:\n\n```\ntest.js:\n│function foo() {\n⋮\n│function bar() {\n⋮\n│function baz() {\n⋮\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or not, or if it's the intended behaviour, it just didn't seem right to me so I'm reporting it. The default behaviour makes working with even moderately sized projects blast past my repo map size with huge reams of implementation code, and aider is not able to make the LLM aware of much of these projects' surface area. It's particularly severe on Go projects, where implementations tend to be much less dense and much more spread out than python projects.\n\nIf it's not expected, I'm happy to submit a PR, I just wanted to confirm first.\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider v0.82.2\nModel: ollama_chat/qwen2.5-coder:14b with whole edit format\nGit repo: .git with 6 files\nRepo-map: using 8192 tokens, auto refresh",

This will help the progress and keeping track of with the code changes we need.\r\nThe best would be taking the example from Github: we need just three things:  \r\n- feature requests (aka TODO)\r\n- bug reports (aka TOFIX)\r\n- tasklist\r\n\r\nThe user should be able to create those with two new aider commands:  \r\n  \r\n**“/task feature <description>”** : add a feature request description\r\n**“/task bug <description>”** : add a bug report\r\n  \r\nAlso the AI should be able to create those entries by itself in the /ask mode if the user asks for new features, or if the user report a bug.\r\n\r\nThose two kind of entries could also be imported from the github repo issues list, with a command like this:  \r\n  \r\n**“/github-sync _repo url_”**  \r\n\r\nYou should also be able to specify if you want just to sync the bugs and/or the features:  \r\n  \r\n**“/github-sync _repo url_ features bugs”**\r\n\r\nWhen you need to have a overview of the project progress, you should be able to call a command like:  \r\n  \r\n**“/task list”**\r\n\r\n...and getting a result like:  \r\n  \r\n**TASKLIST:**\r\n\r\n| n | Description                                            | Reference URL                                      | Status         |\r\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|\r\n| 1 | [❇️ Feat] Add user authentication feature                        | https://github.com/myproject/issues/45             | 📝 planned     |\r\n| 2 | [🪲Bug] Fix crash on startup when configuration is missing     | https://github.com/myproject/issues/32             | ✅ solved      |\r\n| 3 | [❇️ Feat] Implement dark mode for the application                |                                                   | 📝 planned     |\r\n| 4 | [🪲Bug] Resolve memory leak in data processing module          | https://github.com/myproject/issues/19             | 🔄 in progress |\r\n| 5 | [❇️ Feat] Add support for exporting data in CSV format           | https://github.com/myproject/issues/52             | 📝 planned     |\r\n| 6 | [🪲Bug] Correct typo in user settings description              |                                                   | ✅ solved      |\r\n| 7 | [❇️ Feat] Create an admin dashboard for monitoring activities    |                                                   | 📝 planned     |\r\n| 8 | [🪲Bug] Address layout issues on mobile devices                | https://github.com/myproject/issues/27             |  📝 planned |\r\n| 9 | [❇️ Feat] Integrate third-party API for weather updates          |                                                   | 📝 planned     |\r\n| 10 | [🪲Bug] Fix broken link in the help documentation              |                                                   | ❌ wontfix     |\r\n\r\n**Project Status Summary:**\r\n- 📝 Planned: 6\r\n- ✅ Solved: 2\r\n- ❌ Wontfix: 1\r\n- 🔄 In Progress: 1\r\n\r\n**Write a task number and the new status (Example: “21 solved”). “n drop” to delete a task.

Not only is this helpful for humans, but it also makes it easier for the AI to understand the functions and interactions as the project grows and it makes updates and enhancements more accurate.\r\n\r\nI was wondering whether it could be helpful to have an enhanced option of the repo map that, if there is a docstring that explains a function, it includes that information to help better guide the AI.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n def create_task(title: str, description: str, due_date: date, priority: int = 1) -> Task:\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n      Purpose:\r\n          Create a new task with the given details.\r\n      Parameters:\r\n          title (str): Non-empty string up to 200 characters.\r\n          description (str): Optional, up to 1000 characters.\r\n          due_date (date): Must be a future date.\r\n          priority (int, optional): Between 1 and 5 (default is 1).\r\n      Returns:\r\n          Task: The newly created task object.\r\n      Raises:\r\n          ValidationError: If inputs fail validation.\r\n      Notes:\r\n          - Initializes task status to 'Not Started'.\r\n          - Triggers notification to project managers.\r\n      Sanity Checks:\r\n          - Validate input lengths and ranges.\r\n          - Ensure due_date is in the future.\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\nAider v0.59.1\r\nMain model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 with diff edit format, prompt cache, infinite output\r\nWeak model: claude-3-haiku-20240307\r\nGit repo: .git with 23 files\r\nRepo-map: using 1024 tokens, files refresh",

I only use aider in no-auto-commit mode, as I like to view the changes in my editor and control the commits myself. In this workflow, the undo command currently in aider is of no use.\r\n\r\nI often find myself in a situation where I write a prompt that doesn't do what I want, and I therefore want to revert it. This command would do exactly that, allowing me to write a different prompt, or maybe remove more prompts.\r\n\r\nI can imagine it working like this:\r\n\r\ncommand: /undo-prompt\r\nresult: Undoes all edits done by the last prompt, and resets the chat history to what it was before the last prompt was issued. Can be issued multiple times to gradually remove prompts until there are none left.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this gets considered added!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\n_No response_",

However, Aider currently stages and commits all modified files.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't align with my method of working alongside Aider, where I prefer to commit only the staged files, not every changed file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've observed that Aider overlooks new files during `/commit`. If `/commit` is designed to stage and commit all changes, excluding new files appears to be an oversight.\r\n\r\nFinally, during refactors, I often end up with numerous uncommitted files. I need to segment these into several commits. Even if I wanted Aider to commit everything, I would encounter a \"diff too large\" error.\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider v0.43.4\r\nModels: openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet with diff edit format, weak model gpt-3.5-turbo\r\nGit repo: .git with 505 files\r\nRepo-map: using 1024 tokens\r\nVSCode terminal detected, pretty output has been disabled.\r\nUse /help <question> to ask for help, run with --help to see cmd line args",

I think such an aliasing mechanism is needed for these setups (or, indeed, for any equivalent setups where developers have to go through a proxy).\n\nIs there any simple way to do this? I’ve tried renaming the models on LiteLLM to match the “defaults”, and that sort of works for OpenAI models (because in that case I can tell it that gpt-4o on Azure is “normal” gpt-4o with a custom OpenAI endpoints), but it can’t really figure out how to use deepseek-r1 or Claude, and gets confused by there being an “OpenAI” endpoint, or about what context length is supported, etc. \n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

It would really help me centralize costs, understand prompts etc.\n\nThe integration is [super easy](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/observability/langfuse_integration), basically :\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport litellm\nif all(\n    os.environ.get(\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\", None),\n    os.environ.get(\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\", None),\n    ):\n    litellm.success_callback = [\"langfuse\"]\n    litellm.failure_callback = [\"langfuse\"]\n```\n\nAlternatively you could look for \"AIDER_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\" and if present rename it to \"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\".\n\nAlso note that langfuse needs to be installed because litellm will then try to import it.\n\nCan you consider adding it?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\nPS: going the extra mile would be adding a \"tags\" : [\"aider\"] in the metadata of requests, as [described here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/observability/langfuse_integration)\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Issue\n\nI basically cannot use Aider because of the following issue:\n\nI have a Python source file like this:\n\n```\ndef make_recipe_gemini(metadata: dict, transcription: str) -> None:\n```\n\nAider basically cannot keep this `metadata: dict` part. It gets transformed into `meta dict`, which of course breaks all code, which it recognised with the internal flake8 pass.\n\nIt's not a bug in Claude, it's Aider who is already giving the buggy inputs!\n\n\nFor example, this is still before LLM response, when I ask: \n```\nin process.py where is this meta dict coming from??? make it metadata: dict\n```\n\n```\n-------\nASSISTANT I see there's a typo in the function signature in process.py where it says `meta dict` instead of `meta dict`. I'll need to edit that file to fix it.\nASSISTANT \nASSISTANT Please add process.py to the chat so I can make the correction.\n-------\n```\n\nI've managed to create a minimum reproducible .llm.history, uploaded here as txt.\n\n[llm.history.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19034589/llm.history.txt)\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider 0.75.1\nmodel: openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet (same with 3.5)\n\n\n",

      "title": "Q: [Docs] Improve Python Scripting API Documentation with Practical Examples",
      "body": "### Issue\n\n**Labels:** `documentation`, `enhancement`, `python-api`\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe current documentation for the Python scripting API is lacking in practical, codebase-derived examples. This issue proposes updating the documentation with multiple code snippets based on common use cases seen within the aider project itself. This will offer users clearer guidance on how to use the API effectively, while also providing examples that should be more stable over time.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n*   The existing documentation is abstract, lacking real-world examples that can help users quickly understand how to apply the Python API.\n*   Users need to see a variety of usage patterns, demonstrating how to chain requests, pass in various parameters and work with the results.\n*   Users need a sense for how best to handle errors, or problems they may encounter when using the API.\n*   Using examples from the existing codebase makes the examples more practical, more durable and less error prone.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n\n*   **Provide enhanced documentation using concrete examples:** Showcase different use cases with clear, practical examples. Use code from the aider repo itself, which is well tested.\n*   **Explain core classes:**  Clarify the purposes of and interactions between `aider.coders.Coder`, `aider.models.Model`, and `aider.io.InputOutput` with real-world examples.\n*   **Illustrate method usage:** Demonstrate how to effectively use `Coder.create()` and `Coder.run()` to send messages and apply changes.\n*   **Add specific examples:** Provide a number of new examples that cover these topics:\n    *   Basic scripting, showing how to create the `Coder` and call `run()`.\n    *   Chaining together multiple commands.\n    *   Customizing a Coder by selecting a specific model, edit format and other parameters.\n    *   Working with temporary directories to manage temporary files while working with the API.\n    *   Setting the --yes parameter via the IO class.\n    *   Provide examples that return the output of `coder.run()` and error handling.\n*   **Clearly state limitations:** Warn users about the unofficial nature of the API, so they understand that changes may occur over time, which may require updates to their scripts.\n\n**Example Code Snippets (from the proposed documentation):**\n\n**Basic Scripting Example:**\n```python\nfrom aider.coders import Coder\nfrom aider.models import Model\nfrom aider.io import InputOutput\n\n# This is a list of files to add to the chat\nfnames = [\"greeting.py\"]\n\nmodel = Model(\"gpt-4-turbo\")\n\n# Create an io object (required) and optionally enable confirmations with yes=True\nio = InputOutput(yes=True)\n\n# Create a coder object\ncoder = Coder.create(main_model=model, io=io, fnames=fnames)\n\n# This will execute one instruction on those files and then return the last LLM message\nresult = coder.run(\"make a script that prints hello world\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\n**Chain Multiple Instructions**\n```python\nfrom aider.coders import Coder\nfrom aider.models import Model\nfrom aider.io import InputOutput\n\n# This is a list of files to add to the chat\nfnames = [\"greeting.py\"]\n\nmodel = Model(\"gpt-4-turbo\")\n# Create an io object\nio = InputOutput(yes=True)\n\n# Create a coder object\ncoder = Coder.create(main_model=model, io=io, fnames=fnames)\n\n# This will execute one instruction on those files\nresult1 = coder.run(\"make a script that prints hello world\")\nprint(\"Result 1:\", result1)\n\n# Send another instruction\nresult2 = coder.run(\"make it say goodbye\")\nprint(\"Result 2:\", result2)\n\n# You can run in-chat \"/\" commands too\nresult3 = coder.run(\"/tokens\")\nprint(\"Result 3:\", result3)\n```\n\n**Using `Coder.create` with Custom Settings**\n```python\nfrom aider.coders import Coder\nfrom aider.models import Model\nfrom aider.io import InputOutput\nfrom aider.coders.base_coder import UnknownEditFormat\n\ntry:\n    # Create an io object and use it for both Coder instances\n    io = InputOutput(\n        pretty=True,\n        yes=True,\n    )\n\n    # Use gpt-3.5-turbo with a specific diff edit format for the main Coder\n    model1 = Model(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n    coder1 = Coder.create(main_model=model1, edit_format=\"udiff\", io=io, fnames=[\"code.py\"])\n    result1 = coder1.run(\"Write a fibonacci method.\")\n    print(\"Coder 1 Result:\", result1)\n\n    # Use a different model and edit format for a second coder.\n    model2 = Model(\"gpt-4\")\n    coder2 = Coder.create(main_model=model2, edit_format=\"whole\", io=io)\n    result2 = coder2.run(\"make a class to hold the result\")\n    print(\"Coder 2 Result:\", result2)\n\nexcept UnknownEditFormat as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to create Coder with bad edit format: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Working with Temporary Files**\n```python\nimport tempfile\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nfrom aider.coders import Coder\nfrom aider.models import Model\nfrom aider.io import InputOutput\n\nwith tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:\n    # create a new file in a temporary dir\n    test_file = Path(temp_dir) / \"test_file.py\"\n    with open(test_file, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\"initial content\")\n\n    model = Model(\"gpt-4-turbo\")\n    # create an io object\n    io = InputOutput(yes=True)\n\n    # Create a coder object\n    coder = Coder.create(main_model=model, io=io, fnames=[str(test_file)])\n    # Run aider to edit the temporary file\n    coder.run(\"Make it say hello\")\n\n    print(f\"Content of {test_file}: {test_file.read_text()}\")\n```\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The core of this example uses the \"text\" property to get the contents of the messages that come back from the LLM.\n*   The IO object is a required argument. Aider also requires that it is set up with the desired options, like `yes`.\n*   This example showcases some of the options supported in `Coder.create()`.\n\n**Impact:**\n\nThis improvement would enable developers to more easily integrate Aider into their workflows and create powerful automation scripts.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   Implement changes to `aider/website/docs/scripting.md`.\n*   Review new examples for correctness and clarity.\n*   Test all examples against the latest version of aider.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any adjustments or if there's anything else I can do to help.\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n  * Please add `--architect-auto-accept`\r\n\r\nHi there, I developed a front end to aid.chat called `advanced-aicode` (you can install it with `pip install advanced-aicode` and then use `aicode`, which makes aider easier to use and uses better defaults. I've been developing it off an on since aider first became popular.\r\n\r\nI recently turned made architect mode the default when it launches aider.\r\n\r\nThe architect mode is very powerful! However it's adding a little bit of UX friction in that it requires that I say yes to the proposed edits. I'd like to propose the option to pass a command line arg to aider chat so that it can always assume yes for applying the edits for architect mode.\r\n\r\nThis allows the workflow where we are using VSCode's git visual diff to look at the file diff. This is much easier to use than looking at the raw diff edits.\r\n\r\nSomething like `--architect-auto-accept`\r\n\r\n*Misc*\r\n\r\nI want to mention that one of the best features of `advanced-aicode` is that it has special logic for creating an isolated environment using uv for the private aider.chat install. This avoids dependency issues that everyone in this space is facing right now. I think if you backported this feature into aider it would really make it a better product to install. I used pipx before but that doesn't want to remove the aider.chat install and made upgrading aider.chat a work of brain surgery. This upgrade system I have because of UV is nearly painless, although there are corner cases if `aicode` is running in other processes, but for those corner cases and do rollback and restore the install when a locked file exception is thrown during upgrade.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for such a great open source project. \r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\nAider 0.62.1",

I couldn't figure out how to report timing metrics from Aider or I would post a quantitative comparison.\n\nIn addition to a delay before response, I've noticed sometimes that deepseek-r1 will slow to a crawl when responding with code edits.\n\nIn contrast, if I point to gpt-4o the response is BLAZINGLY fast. \n\nAny suggestions on how I can profile and troubleshoot this speed issue?\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider v0.74.2\nModel: mistral, deepseek-r1:32b\nGit repo: empty",

If installation is accepted, the installation passes but fails on the chromium install.\n\nIt seems that aider doesn't have knowledge of anything available on the shell or globally.\n\nBoth git and playwright are in the path and available from any shell.\n\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider: v0.72.2\nOS: linux 6.12.10.arch1-1\nGit: 2.48.1-1",

Tell me how many \"r\"s are in the word \"Strawberry\"\n\nI tried testing them out in Openrouter's chatroom.\nI noticed that the models/APIs were not lagging, but that they took a lot of time to think before they responded.  \nAnd I could see what they were thinking as they did. \n\n<img width=\"624\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37257604-c89d-4091-86e8-7e64d9b3b09f\" />\n\n\nIt would help my user experience A LOT, if I could see this thought process when using Aider.  \nDo I have to wait because it's thinking, is it thinking in the right direction? (If it's not, I can cancel the request and direct it better)\nOr is it the API just stuck?  \n\nSince the OpenRouter chatroom can get the reasoning tokens, I assume that we can too?\n\n### Version and model info\n\naider 0.72.3\nmodel: openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1\n\n",

Please add the full contents of `test-data-set/strncat.cpp` to the chat.\nTokens: 1.7k sent, 55 received. Cost: $0.0092 message, $0.0092 session.\n```\n\nIs it possible that both actions - adding the file and executing the instructions - are being executed asynchronously in parallel?

I would like to have a hotkey i can hit to automate `/drop` for something matching a pattern!\r\n\r\nEven better! By default drop any images. If we want it back we can easily copy the file path that was shown in the earlier prompt in the terminal... or since with official flow it's still potentially in the clipboard one could just re-run `/paste`!\r\n\r\nSo then for the streamlined workflow what I would love to have is: \r\n\r\n- auto drop images after one prompt to aider with the image\r\n- a hotkey we can type to run `/paste` to slurp up image immediately without typing `/paste`. no biggie since user can /drop it manually if it was accidental. Bonus points if we can hit the key and make it do this to add the image from clipboard while we are already in the middle of prompt editing.",

      "body": "I tried asking aider to add a cell to a Jupyter notebook. It *worked*, but showing the diff is kind of low-level, because it's a JSON diff. (I suppose this is a side-effect of Jupyter notebooks not being especially friendly for editing in plain text.)\r\n\r\nThe notebook looks okay, but it doesn't include the prompt that I gave to GPT4, or GPT4's non-code responses. Also, aider auto-committed the change, which is bad because I didn't execute the notebook cell yet. (This generates the image.)\r\n\r\nMaybe Jupyter notebook integration should be a different project altogether, but here are some suggestions:\r\n\r\n * Convert a Python notebook to a different format that's more friendly to send to GPT4? This could reduce the amount of time spent generating boilerplate.\r\n \r\n* When GPT4 adds one code cell to a notebook, add the prompt as a markdown cell before the code cell that GPT4 added.\r\n\r\n* Instead of auto-committing, maybe aider should pop up the file in your text editor and let you edit it? (In this case, VS Code.)",

      "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nSorry if this is the wrong place to suggest, but I have been using Aider in production for some time now, it's great but it can be even greather if it allows us to add multiple agents or more than 1 layer of answer. Let me explain:\r\n\r\n1. I ask Aider to change an existing class for me\r\n2. Aider modifies the code\r\n3. I have to review the code to check if he does not mess up with the current functionality of the code\r\n\r\nWell, we will always do the 3rd, but Aider would be even greater if we can add an extra layer of response. Basically, a code reviewer that you can enable or not, how it would work:\r\n\r\n1. Same\r\n2. Same\r\n3. Modified code go through the \"reviewer agent\", the instructions of the reviewer can be custom, I would use something like: \"You received a request to do X, please check if your resulting code does as asked, also, please make sure your changes were just the needed to perform the task and nothing outside this scope was modified.\" - He can emit an opinion like \"Reviewer says: The code is OK\". (I'm talking about an extra request to GTP or whatever AI)\r\n4. I review the code but more confident now ;)\r\n\r\nThe \"reviewer\" is basically just an extra layer of response, it can be anything, and even can have multi layers that allows the result to be more scrutinized and improved. Ex: I can have an extra layer asking it to improve the performance of the generated code.\r\n\r\nI've searched for similar tools with multiple agents, but the only tool that I found that modifies well an existing code base is Aider, AI is going to the path of multi-agents, one that verifies what the previous one did, this suggestion follows this same trend and would be really useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for building Aider s2\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "title": "pre-commit hooks are ignored by Aider when used on projects",
      "body": "### Issue\n\nHi, this is a really fantastic project !!!\r\n\r\nRecently, I noticed Aider isn't respecting pre-commit hooks for projects.  I have tried both the .git/hooks/precommit and the python pre-commit package and in all cases failing pre-commit hook tests will not prevent Aider from committing to a repo.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this could be due to the default Aider auto-commit mode using `--no-verify` somewhere ( I don't see any places in the repo where this is happening) or if instead this might be a side effect of the  gitpython client library.  I have found a function in the gitpython docs [run_commit_hook](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html?highlight=hook#git.index.fun.run_commit_hook), but my limited understanding is that gitpython doesn't respect hooks and only gives you the run_commit_hook to manually override specific commits you pass through.  I think it would be easy to add a feature to look at the .git/hooks/repo/precommit or .precommit yaml to pass through precommit calls to the gitpython function.  Alternatively,  would it be possible to set the autocommit to use shell command git so the hooks get picked up?\r\n\r\n1) Is there a way to make Aider to respect pre-commit hooks with commits or autocommits?\r\n2) Is there a better workflow for forcing Aider to iterate on a prompt until tests are passing?\r\n\r\nI have been using Aider for web development tasks that included end-to-end and integration tests for nodejs api service with jest testing and I have noticed that Aider can sometimes break a number of tests without realizing it.  I would like to use pre-commit test hooks to make Aider stop and correct broken tests before moving forward.  In an ideal setting the pre-commit test hook would run show Aider what broke and direct Aider to go back or revert to the previous commit before trying more fixes. \r\n\r\nI have not tested the pre-commit hook behavior with other testing frameworks other than Jest.\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider v0.42.0\r\nModels: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 with diff edit format, weak model \r\nclaude-3-haiku-20240307\r\nGit repo: .git with 78 files\r\nRepo-map: using 1024 tokens\r\n\r\n.pre-commit-config.yaml\r\n```yaml\r\nrepos:\r\n  - repo: local\r\n    hooks:\r\n      - id: run-tests\r\n        name: Run Jest tests\r\n        entry: yarn jest --silent\r\n        language: system\r\n        pass_filenames: false\r\n        files: .*\\.(test|spec)\\.[jt]sx?$\r\n```",

      "body": "### Issue\n\nFeature request - Create a plugin architecture for aider.\r\n\r\nThis could be used, for example, to create custom commands for Aider. As well as extending the use of Aider, it might encourage more community contribution and \"buzz\" around Aider.\r\n\r\nSome inspiration could be taken from\r\nhttps://github.com/simonw/llm by Simon Willison, his LLM tool allows the creation of plugins. (He uses https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) See also https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins.html .\r\n\r\nI think that custom commands would be handy for aider, and the ability to easily use it from the command line for 1-shot tasks would be great.\r\n\r\nFor example, to implement interactive help for Aider itself.\r\nYou can clone the aider repo, run aider in the base dir and /load key files, then /ask questions. This can get expensive if you load too many files. However, someone could set up an optimal configuration that minimizes costs but returns useful help for aider. This configuration could be loaded as a plugin \"interactive help for aider\".\r\n\r\nThis utility would extend to any bleeding edge or obscure repo. LLMs hallucinate badly about such things that are not seen much in their training data, but a plugin that cloned a repo, /load files and provided much better context would be helpful.\r\nThis would be handy during an interactive aider coding session when using a more obscure repo, to provide more context to the LLM for coding.\r\n\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

The idea it to store in a Json config different custom prompts, so if you wanted aider to work as a QA engineer one could fine tune the prompt for that role. Or if you wanted to restrict to coding in a specific language or framework you could do that.\n\n It would be something similar to Claude's style feature where you could customise the style of it's output?\n\n\n",

      "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a tool that automatically fixes TypeScript compilation errors in a large monorepo (800k lines) by scripting `aider` (we are enabling strict mode, and have 10,000+ errors to fix).\r\n\r\nThe approach I have works well for simple fixes, but `aider` is consistently 'blind' to the types that are directly imported from the target files (which contain the types it would need to understand to fix most issues).\r\n\r\nI took a look at the repo map that gets output, and it's dominated by common aliases / imports that occur a lot in the codebase, and with 5000 tokens, nothing within a graph distance of even 1 (e.g. direct imports) is present, which means `aider` is completely blind to the most important information.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the implementation of [RepoMap](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/blob/dba844c7f96ff05ca0ea76659a2f521689d0d324/aider/repomap.py#L226), it looks to me like actually, it is intended to weight references heavily, and this probably works in smaller repos.\r\n\r\nI'd like to improve this use case. I'm happy to experiment and open PRs to `aider`, but I wanted to ask your thoughts first before I proceed, as per CONTRIBUTING.md.\r\n\r\nThis may be solvable through tweaking the weights (and just allowing those weights to be customized by the end user).\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly naive approach:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        # Determine weight multiplier\r\n        if ident in mentioned_idents:\r\n            mul = 10\r\n        elif ident.startswith('_'):\r\n            mul = 0.1\r\n        else:\r\n            # Here's where we can boost direct imports from chat files\r\n            referencer_is_chat_file = referencer in chat_rel_fnames\r\n            if referencer_is_chat_file:\r\n                mul = 50  # Much higher weight for references from chat files\r\n            else:\r\n                mul = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut essentially we'd want higher weights for files that are closer to the current file.\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Issue\n\n**Summary:**\r\n\r\nThis feature request proposes adding support for using proxies with Aider, the AI pair programming tool.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\n\r\nCurrently, Aider directly connects to LLM APIs, which can be problematic in certain scenarios:\r\n\r\n* **Network Restrictions:** Users behind firewalls or in environments with restricted internet access may be unable to directly connect to LLM APIs.\r\n* **Privacy Concerns:** Some users may prefer routing their requests through a proxy for added privacy.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nImplement a configuration option within Aider to specify a proxy server address and port. Aider would then route all API requests through this proxy.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Details:**\r\n\r\n* **Configuration:**\r\n\r\nAdd a new section to the Aider configuration file  for proxy settings. This section could include fields for:\r\n\r\n    * `proxy_host`: The hostname or IP address of the proxy server.\r\n    * `proxy_port`: The port number of the proxy server.\r\n    * `proxy_type`: (Optional) The type of proxy (e.g., HTTP, SOCKS5).\r\n    *  `credentials`: dict to store creds\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n* **Increased Accessibility:** Enables Aider to be used in environments with network restrictions.\r\n* **Enhanced Privacy:** Provides an additional layer of privacy for users concerned about data exposure.\r\n* **Improved Reliability:** Proxies can help mitigate issues caused by network instability or rate limiting.\r\n\r\n**Additional Considerations:**\r\n\r\n* **Proxy Authentication:** Consider supporting proxy authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, API keys) for enhanced security.\r\n* **Proxy Selection:** Allow users to choose from a list of pre-configured proxies or specify custom proxy settings and apply round robin algorithm\r\n\r\nBy implementing proxy support, Aider can become more versatile and accessible to a wider range of users.\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider v0.41.0\r\nModel: gemini/gemini-1.5-pro-latest with diff-fenced edit format\r\nGit repo: .git with 16 files\r\nRepo-map: using 1024 tokens",

      "body": "I like the idea to have in Aider-chat a steps.json file  that executes a series of predefined steps to modify, extend, or improve files using a JSON configuration. The system should handle file paths for reading and writing content.\n\nAider should:\n1. Read from a configuration file (`steps.json`) containing an ordered list of operations\n2. Execute each step sequentially based on the JSON structure\n3. Handle file paths for both reading reference files and writing output\n4. Process operations based on configuration parameters\n5. when the process finishes , we can use aider normally from terminal\n\n### Configuration Parameters\nEach step in the JSON supports the following parameters:\n- `prompt`: The instruction to execute\n- `confirm`: Whether user confirmation is needed\n- `add_terminal`: If terminal output should be added\n- `other_possible_request_of_aider`: Additional aider-specific options\n- `read_only`: (Optional) Path to a reference file\n- `add`:  (Optional)  Path to the output file\n\n### Example Configuration\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"Create a list of ten visual examples of the first newton law in a markdown section\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false,\n        \"read_only\": \"path/to/reference/file.md\",\n        \"add\": \"path/to/output/newton_first_law.md\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"improve this list\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false\n    }\n]\n```\n\nI think this is a really helpful if I want to create syntetic data, in example:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"Create a list of ten visual examples of the first newton law in a markdown section\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false,\n \"read_only\": \"path/to/reference/file.md\",\n        \"add\": \"path/to/output/newton_first_law.md\"\n\n    },\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"improve this list\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false,\n\n    },\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"Create a second list of ten visual examples of the first newton law in a markdown section\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false,\n\n    },\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"improve the list of the second law of newton\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false,\n\n    },\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"Create a third list of ten visual examples of the first newton law in a markdown section\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false,\n\n    },\n    {\n        \"prompt\": \"improve the list of the second law of newton\",\n        \"confirm\": true,\n        \"add_terminal\": false,\n        \"other_possible_request_of_aider\": false,\n\n    }\n]\n\n```\n\nmaybe is already possible , but I dont know how to do it \n\n",

Each of these packages is its own separate repository. When I run Aider on the main project, it only has knowledge of the code in that top-level repository and doesn’t map or understand these external packages.\n\nI’d like to know if there’s a recommended workflow or best practice for handling multi-repo setups so that Aider can incorporate (or at least reference) these Composer-managed vendor packages. Specifically, I want Aider to be aware of and possibly refactor or suggest changes that involve code in those vendor packages as well.\n\nQuestions\n\nDoes Aider currently support scanning/updating multiple separate Git repositories in a single project context?\nAre there recommended approaches, such as Git submodules or combining repos, to make Aider “see” the vendor packages?\nAny best practices, tips, or known approaches for similar Composer-based multi-repo Symfony/PHP projects?\nThank you!\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\nCurrently it's only possible to use aider only via terminal or via its own browser interface. I think it would be cool, if we could run Aider as an http server with OpenAI compatible API. This way, we could easily integrate it into Continue Dev or Open WebUI or basically any tool that supports this API (which is a lot).\r\n\r\nFor example I can imagine, that with Continue we could also add aider's commands as custom. And have a well-crafted VSCode extension for it.\r\n\r\nGiven possibilities of Continue I also see myself creating several characters (using .prompt files with custom system message): business analyst, architect etc.. And after thorough discussion and planning of the edit - aider would be given with more complete instructions of what to do.\r\n\r\nIn my mind aider is a fantastic tool, and I think it would be even better if we were able to feed in the tasks one by one in small steps. Rather than have multi-step plan at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday I tried doing it myself via piping prompts between http and CLI, but unfortunately wasn't able to get it to work reliably.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are a few of my attempts:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport asyncio\r\nimport json\r\nimport time\r\nimport logging\r\nfrom typing import Optional, List\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\nfrom starlette.responses import StreamingResponse, JSONResponse\r\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI(title=\"OpenAI-compatible API\")\r\naider_process = None\r\naider_output_queue = asyncio.Queue()\r\n\r\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n\r\nasync def start_aider():\r\n    global aider_process\r\n    logger.debug(\"Starting aider process...\")\r\n    aider_process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(\r\n        'aider', '--deepseek',\r\n        stdin=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,\r\n        stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,\r\n        stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE\r\n    )\r\n    logger.debug(\"Aider process started.\")\r\n    asyncio.create_task(read_output(aider_process.stdout))\r\n    asyncio.create_task(read_output(aider_process.stderr))\r\n\r\nasync def read_output(stream):\r\n    while True:\r\n        line = await stream.readline()\r\n        if not line:\r\n            break\r\n        decoded_line = line.decode().strip()\r\n        logger.debug(f\"Received line from aider: {decoded_line}\")\r\n        await aider_output_queue.put(decoded_line)\r\n\r\nclass Message(BaseModel):\r\n    role: str\r\n    content: str\r\n\r\nclass ChatCompletionRequest(BaseModel):\r\n    model: Optional[str] = \"aider\"\r\n    messages: List[Message]\r\n    max_tokens: Optional[int] = 512\r\n    temperature: Optional[float] = 0.1\r\n    stream: Optional[bool] = False\r\n\r\nasync def get_aider_response(timeout=60):\r\n    response = []\r\n    start_time = time.time()\r\n    response_started = False\r\n    while (time.time() - start_time) <= timeout:\r\n        try:\r\n            line = await asyncio.wait_for(aider_output_queue.get(), timeout=1)\r\n            if \"Assistant:\" in line:\r\n                response_started = True\r\n            #

The provided SCM files should follow the Tree-sitter naming convention: either `tree-sitter-{lang}-tags.scm` or `{lang}.scm`.\r\n\r\nWhen processing files, the system should first check if a user-provided SCM file matches the current programming language before falling back to the default queries folder.\r\n\r\nIf you think this feature would be valuable, I'd be happy to work on implementing it and submit a PR. Please let me know if you're interested and if you have any specific requirements or guidelines for the implementation.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this request!\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

      "title": "Feature Request: Add `/auto-lint` and `/lint-mode` Commands for Enhanced Linting Control",
      "body": "### Issue\n\n### Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, `aider` provides an option to enable auto-linting through the `--auto-lint` flag when starting a session. However, users may find themselves needing more granular control over linting behavior during a session. This proposal suggests two in-chat commands: `/auto-lint` to toggle auto-linting and `/lint-mode` to allow switching between different linting modes (`auto`, `off`, `summary`).\r\n\r\n### Proposed Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### 1. **`/auto-lint` Command**\r\n\r\nThe `/auto-lint` command would allow users to toggle the auto-lint setting on or off during an active session. This will be particularly useful when users want to temporarily disable or re-enable auto-linting without restarting the session.\r\n\r\n- **Toggle Behavior**: \r\n  - `/auto-lint`: Switches the current auto-linting state. If linting is currently on, it turns off, and vice versa.\r\n  \r\n- **Explicit Setting**:\r\n  - `/auto-lint true`: Explicitly enables auto-linting.\r\n  - `/auto-lint false`: Explicitly disables auto-linting.\r\n\r\n#### 2. **`/lint-mode` Command**\r\n\r\nThe `/lint-mode` command would provide more flexibility by allowing users to switch between different linting modes. This would mirror the existing `/chat-mode` command and allow users to better control when and how linting occurs.\r\n\r\n- **Modes**:\r\n  - `auto`: Auto-linting runs after every code change (current behavior).\r\n  - `off`: Disables linting completely until explicitly turned back on.\r\n  - `summary`: Linting only provides a summary of issues without prompting for fixes. This mode allows users to make multiple changes without interruption, and review all linting issues at once after several modifications.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n/lint-mode auto   # Automatically lint after each change\r\n/lint-mode off    # Disable linting for now\r\n/lint-mode summary  # Show a summary of lint issues but don’t interrupt for fixes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example Use Case\r\n\r\nA common scenario where this feature would be useful is when working with Python code that mixes typed (e.g., using Pydantic) and non-typed code. In such cases, small linting errors (e.g., type-related issues) may be flagged frequently. Rather than being interrupted for each individual error, users may prefer to work in `summary` mode and address all issues at once after completing several changes.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. Start in `auto` mode for continuous linting.\r\n2. Switch to `summary` mode to make a series of changes without interruption.\r\n3. Review the summary of lint issues and address them all at once.\r\n4. Optionally return to `auto` mode after addressing the bulk of the issues for ongoing linting.\r\n\r\nThis flexible approach helps prevent interruptions and can streamline the workflow when making a series of modifications.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n- **Granular Control**: Users can toggle between linting modes or completely disable linting when not needed, providing more flexibility.\r\n- **Streamlined Workflow**: In `summary` mode, users can focus on completing several changes before addressing linting issues, reducing interruptions during development.\r\n- **Improved Efficiency**: Particularly useful for mixed Python codebases, where users want to suppress or batch type-related lint issues across several changes.\r\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

However, when using the architect with a simple chat message, the prompt to edit files only accepts y/n. It would be ideal to be able to: also be able to provide additional instructions that get sent to the editor model along with the architect's instructions.\r\n\r\nUse case: you've asked the architect to design an implementation for xyz feature, most of it is good except one point and you want to tell the editor not to do that particular thing but everything else, or slightly modify the architects instructions without going through another turn of chat with the architect (loss of time and money). \r\n\n\n### Version and model info\n\nlatest\r\no1-mini (architect), sonnet (editor)",

From our         \nconversation history, I remember that they provided some instructions about how \nto format responses when suggesting code changes. They emphasized using a       \nspecific file listing format with the filename and triple backticks.            \n\nI need to respond in a way that acknowledges their request but also reminds them\nof the correct format for providing files. Since they mentioned package.json,   \nit's likely they want me to review or modify it. However, without seeing the    \nactual content, I can't proceed.                                                \n\nSo, I should ask them to share the file using the specified format. That way, I \ncan ensure I receive all necessary information correctly and provide an accurate\nresponse. I'll make sure my reply is clear and follows their instructions       \nprecisely.                                                                      \n\n\nI don't currently have access to your package.json file or any other files in   \nyour project. Could you please share it with me using the file listing format?  \nThis will help me understand your project structure and suggest appropriate     \nchanges if needed.                                                              \n\nPlease provide your package.json file like this:                                \n\npackage.json                                                                    \n",

      "body": "### Issue\n\nAider supports an `extra_params` model setting. The docs show setting `extra_headers` like this:\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: aider/extra_params\r\n  extra_params:\r\n    extra_headers:\r\n      Custom-Header: value\r\n      accept: application/json\r\n    max_tokens: 8192\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut using that setting, it adds `extra_headers` to the JSON payload, not as HTTP headers. With liteLLM verbose logging enabled it shows the request.\r\n\r\nNote at the end how `extra_body` and `extra_headers` are part of the POST body instead of HTTP headers.\r\n\r\nI need to be able to set custom HTTP headers in order to authenticate with our LLM gateway.\r\n\r\nFull request made by aider:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST \\\r\nhttp://REDACTED/v1/chat/completions/ \\\r\n-H 'Authorization: *****' \\\r\n-d '{'model': 'REDACTED', 'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Act as an expert software\r\ndeveloper.\\nAlways use best practices when coding.\\nRespect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the\r\ncode base.\\n\\nTake requests for changes to the supplied code.\\nIf the request is ambiguous, ask questions.\\n\\nAlways reply to the user in\r\nthe same language they are using.\\n\\nOnce you understand the request you MUST:\\n\\n1.

I will call it `subdir` in the further course.\r\n\r\nI would like to specify a `lint-cmd` (`yarn run lint`). Unfortunately aider tries to execute the cmd in the root folder and not in the `subdir`. This then fails because there is no `package.json` etc. in the root.\r\n\r\nIf I set `lint-cmd: “yarn --cwd subdir run lint\"`, then unfortunately the paths of the files are no longer correct, because aider thinks that the command is executed in the root dir and appends the `subdir` before the file:\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`## Running: yarn --cwd subdir run lint subdir/package.json`\r\n\r\nIs there a way to change the root dir in which commands are executed? \r\nI currently start aider in subdir.

      "body": "### Issue\n\nHere is an example session where there are multiple edits to the same file, but aider thinks it is editing the `crystal` file. \nIt seems that either aider should recognise that it is the same file being edited multiple times, i.e. the filename `cli/src/statbus.cr` is used continuously for multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, or the edits should be discarded. \nYou see from the history that there is confusion between the file name and the contents of the block (crystal code).\n\nThe current behaviour is incorrect as it makes a partial edit and then tries to make a new file `crystal`.\n\nSo the essence of the problem is the LLM providing a type specifier for the SEARCH/REPLACE block and aider getting confused because of this.\n\nCopy paste from the aider chat:\n\n````\n> The ::BIGINT casting is not required, just use the Int8 when reading the value.\n\nI'll help remove the unnecessary ::BIGINT casting and update the version handling.

So aider is a great option to create MVP and work on a small features, but can't really handle some bigger tasks including some complex SQL queries with custom business logic and so on.\r\nAnd the most frequent error I'm facing is outdated documentation in model which resulting in wrong code/calls of unknown functions, poor code quality and so on. I'm kinda new to AI so I'm wondering what if add some RAG on the side of aider to add all documentation? Is it good idea in general? \r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Issue\n\nThank you for maintaining this great repo and the blog!\n\n### Problem Description\nAppended is the message dictionary being sent by _litellm=1.53.9_ to the OpenAI server. The role for the first message should be \"system\" but is instead modified by _litellm=1.53.9_ to \"user\". To be clear, aider sent \"system\" but _litellm=1.53.9_ changed it to \"user\". From my own testing with o1, this changes the model behavior.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Use `python -m aider-chat --model o1`\n\n2.

Aider code would drastically shrink in size, yet increase in ability (by knowing more about your project), and performance (less http i/o).  The `/add` command might even be optional to use; the AI could figure out which files are in scope.\r\n\r\nThat's a significant change tho, and would result in a much smaller project.  Likely some new leaner project should be written that does it.   It's probably too early to even make a ticket(s) about this change.  Everyone is just learning what's possible.\r\n\r\nNothing to see here.

      "title": "Enhance aider's Markdown editing capabilities with  --watch-files",
      "body": "Aider is an excellent context-management tool for AI. It would be powerful to extend this to text editing other than programming. For example, Ive used aider --watch-files on a folder of markdown files which is also opened as a vault using obsidian.md.\r\n\r\nCurrently, aider's --watch-files functionality is primarily optimized for code editing. When used with Markdown files, it misinterprets text-based prompts (especially  those containing \"AI!\") as comment removal requests, rather than generating new content. This issue aims to enhance aider's ability to handle Markdown files effectively, allowing users to leverage its context management, file handling, and chat capabilities for writing and editing text in Markdown, while still using Git   \r\nfor version control. The goal is to achieve this without degrading aider's core code editing abilities.                                                                \r\n\r\nDesired Outcome:                                                                                                                                                       \r\n\r\n • aider should correctly interpret text-based prompts in Markdown files, generating new content when requested.                                                       \r\n • aider should not misinterpret \"AI!\" as a comment when it's part of a sentence in a Markdown file.                                                                   \r\n • aider should respect Markdown syntax when making edits.                                                                                                             \r\n • Users should be able to leverage aider's context management, file handling, and chat capabilities for Markdown files.                                               \r\n • aider's core code editing capabilities should remain unaffected.                                                                                                    \r\n • Users should have the option to enable a markdown-specific prompt for more tailored behavior.                                                                       \r\n\r\nProposed Solution:                                                                                                                                                     \r\n\r\nThe following changes will be implemented to address the issue:                                                                                                        \r\n\r\n 1 Flexible File Type Detection:                                                                                                                                       \r\n    • Implementation: Modify FileWatcher.filter_func in aider/watch.py to process all files with AI comments, regardless of file extension.                            \r\n    • Purpose: This allows aider to be used with any file type, including Markdown, while still using the AI comment syntax.                                           \r\n 2 Context-Aware Comment Detection:                                                                                                                                    \r\n    • Implementation: Keep the context-aware comment detection in FileWatcher.get_ai_comments in aider/watch.py, but ensure the ai_comment_pattern is specific enough  \r\n      to avoid misinterpreting \"AI!\" as a comment when it's part of a sentence.                                                                                        \r\n    • Purpose: This prevents aider from incorrectly removing \"AI!\" from text.                                                                                          \r\n 3 Optional Markdown-Specific Prompt:                                                                                                                                  \r\n    • Implementation:                                                                                                                                                  \r\n       • Keep the markdown_prompt in CoderPrompts in aider/coders/base_prompts.py.                                                                                     \r\n       • Add a new command-line argument --use-markdown-prompt to aider/args.py.                                                                                       \r\n       • Modify Coder.format_chat_chunks in aider/coders/base_coder.py to use the markdown_prompt if --use-markdown-prompt is enabled.                                 \r\n    • Purpose: This allows users to choose whether to use a prompt specifically tailored for Markdown files.                                                           \r\n 4 Text Generation Logic:                                                                                                                                              \r\n    • Implementation: Keep the text generation logic in FileWatcher.process_changes in aider/watch.py with the watch_code_prompt and watch_ask_prompt prompts.         \r\n    • Purpose: These prompts will be used when the user ends a comment with AI! or AI?

Plus another point of view on a codebase is usually welcome. \r\n\r\nCan we get API support? It looks to me like AWS has its own libraries for talking to models through its model provisioning business, called Bedrock, so this might or might not be suitable as it will add at least one library to the distribution. I will say that Bedrock claims to support a number of models that I use daily, like Claude 3.5, so it might be a nice feature for users to point at their own bedrock api endpoints rather than directly to Anthropic. Here's their sample inference code for reference. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport boto3\r\n\r\nAWS_REGION = \"us-east-1\"\r\nMODEL_ID = \"amazon.nova-pro-v1:0\"\r\nVIDEO_FILE = \"the-sea.mp4\"\r\n\r\nbedrock_runtime = boto3.client(\"bedrock-runtime\", region_name=AWS_REGION)\r\nwith open(VIDEO_FILE, \"rb\") as f:\r\n    video = f.read()\r\n\r\nuser_message = \"Describe this video.\"\r\n\r\nmessages = [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\r\n    {\"video\": {\"format\": \"mp4\", \"source\": {\"bytes\": video}}},\r\n    {\"text\": user_message}\r\n] } ]\r\n\r\nresponse = bedrock_runtime.converse(\r\n    modelId=MODEL_ID,\r\n    messages=messages,\r\n    inferenceConfig={\"temperature\": 0.0}\r\n )\r\n\r\nresponse_text = response[\"output\"][\"message\"][\"content\"][0][\"text\"]\r\nprint(response_text)\r\n```\n\n### Version and model info\n\n_No response_",

      "title": "Bug Report: Automatic Suggestion Menu Stops Appearing After File Addition via Prompt Instructions",
      "body": "## **Description**\r\nA bug occurs in the Aider tool where the automatic gray suggestion menu (for commands or files) disappears after a file is added indirectly via typing part of the filename into the prompt. This behavior differs from using the explicit `/add` command. After the bug manifests, the menu does not reappear unless Aider is restarted. The tab key still functions for autocompletion, but the absence of the menu significantly impacts usability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Steps to Reproduce**\r\n1. Start typing a command or instruction in Aider that includes part of a filename (e.g., `look into H(...)`).\r\n2. When the gray menu appears, use the tab key to autocomplete the filename (e.g., `Hero.svelte`).\r\n3. Complete the command and press enter.\r\n4. When prompted to add the file, select **Y** to confirm.\r\n5. Observe that:\r\n    - The command computes correctly, and the file is added.\r\n    - The automatic gray menu does not appear for subsequent typing unless Aider is restarted.\r\n6. Attempt using **D** for \"Don't ask again\" when prompted to add the file. Note that the file is not added, and Aider produces an error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Expected Behavior**\r\nThe automatic gray suggestion menu should continue to appear during typing after a file is added through prompt instructions, just as it does when using the `/add` command explicitly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Actual Behavior**\r\n- The menu disappears after adding a file via the typing-prompt method.\r\n- The menu does not reappear unless the tool is restarted.\r\n- Using the **D** option during the add prompt causes the file not to be added, and subsequent functionality depending on the file fails.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Additional Information**\r\n- The issue does not occur if files are added explicitly via the `/add` command.\r\n- The issue negatively impacts usability as it forces manual knowledge of when to press the tab key for autocompletion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\nAider v0.69.1\r\nModel: openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 with whole edit format +sonnet-3.5 with default options (unlimited output etc)\r\nWindows CMD + PS on Win10\r\n",

      "body": "### Issue\n\nHi,\r\nI'm trying to launch the Aider GUI in a folder on my Windows 11 PC, but it crashes as soon as it starts up with `StreamlitAPIException: The default value '<file_name_here>' is part of the options. Please make sure that every default values also exists in the options.`\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I have a folder like so `D:\\code\\shell`. The folder contains only 2 files, one being `.gitignore` and the other is called `tar-to-wsl.sh`. Trying to run Aider with `aider tar-to-wsl.sh` results in fatal error right after the Streamlit interface becomes available in the browser. Here's the info text that shows up when Streamlit is up and running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAider v0.45.1\r\nModels: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 with diff edit format, weak model claude-3-haiku-20240307\r\nGit repo: .git with 0 files\r\nRepo-map: using 1024 tokens\r\nAdded tar-to-wsl.sh to the chat.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shows 0 files in the repo but still adds the requested file to the chat.

      "body": "*This issue is a catch all for questions about using aider with other or local LLMs. The text below is taken from the [FAQ](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#can-i-use-aider-with-other-llms-local-llms-etc).*\r\n\r\nAider provides experimental support for LLMs other than OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The support is currently only experimental for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- GPT-3.5 is just barely capable of *editing code* to provide aider's interactive \"pair programming\" style workflow. None of the other models seem to be as capable as GPT-3.5 yet.\r\n- Just \"hooking up\" aider to a new model by connecting to its API is almost certainly not enough to get it working in a useful way. Getting aider working well with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 was a significant undertaking, involving [specific code editing prompts and backends for each model and extensive benchmarking](https://aider.chat/docs/benchmarks.html). Officially supporting each new LLM will probably require a similar effort to tailor the prompts and editing backends.\r\n\r\nNumerous users have done experiments with numerous models. None of these experiments have yet identified other models that look like they are capable of working well with aider.\r\n\r\nOnce we see signs that a *particular* model is capable of code editing, it would be reasonable for aider to attempt to officially support such a model. Until then, aider will simply maintain experimental support for using alternative models.\r\n\r\n### More information\r\n\r\nFor more information on connecting to other models, local models and Azure models please see the [FAQ](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#can-i-use-aider-with-other-llms-local-llms-etc).\r\n\r\nThere are ongoing discussions about [LLM integrations in the aider discord](https://discord.com/channels/1131200896827654144/1133060780649087048).\r\n\r\nHere are some [GitHub issues which may contain relevant information](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%23172).",

      "title": "Unexpected architect mode like behaviour",
      "body": "### Issue\n\nHi, \r\nI'm not sure if my prompt is just too much for Sonnet or aider actually fails to detect file creation. In my case aider behaves as if run in architect mode. The first response looks legit, but nevertheless the model starts over without aider creating the files.\r\n\r\nCommand: `aider --sonnet --file C:/Users/pwegner/IdeaProjects/KeycloakUI/src/main/kotlin/Main.kt --file C:/Users/pwegner/IdeaProjects/KeycloakUI/build.gradle.kts --file C:/Users/pwegner/IdeaProjects/KeycloakUI/src/main/kotlin/Main.kt --yes --no-suggest-shell-commands --no-pretty --no-fancy-input --no-detect-urls -m $message` where $message is \r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Advanced prompt to create a few md files before starting implementation of a spring boot + react app</summary>\r\nSYSTEM Create plan files in .coding-aider-plans before making code changes:\r\n\r\nSYSTEM File Requirements:\r\n1. Start plans with [Coding Aider Plan]\r\n2. Start checklists with [Coding Aider Plan - Checklist]\r\n3. Checklist items should be atomic and use markdown checkboxes (i.e. - [ ] Taskdescription)\r\n3. Use consistent naming: feature_name.md, _checklist.md, _context.yaml\r\n4. Cross-reference files using markdown links\r\n\r\nSYSTEM Content Guidelines:\r\n- Plans: High-level feature descriptions and major implementation details\r\n- Checklists: Fine-grained implementation steps\r\n- Context YAML format:\r\n  ---\r\n  files:\r\n  - path: full/path/to/file\r\n    readOnly: false\r\n\r\nSYSTEM Implementation:\r\n1. Create/update plan files first\r\n2. Implement changes step by step\r\n3. Keep context.yaml current with all needed files\r\nSYSTEM No plan exists yet. Write a detailed description of the requested feature and the needed changes.\r\n            SYSTEM The main plan file should include these sections: ## Overview, ## Problem Description, ## Goals, ## Additional Notes and Constraints, ## References \r\n            SYSTEM Save the plan in a new markdown file with a suitable name in the .coding-aider-plans directory.\r\n            \r\n            SYSTEM Create subplans when:\r\n            1. A feature requires changes across multiple distinct components\r\n            2. Implementation involves separate logical phases\r\n            3. Different team members could work on parts independently\r\n            4. A component needs its own detailed planning\r\n            5. Changes affect more than 3-4 files\r\n            SYSTEM Subplan Requirements:\r\nSYSTEM 1. Name format: mainplan_subfeature (e.g. authentication_login)\r\nSYSTEM 2. Create all three files per subplan:\r\n   - mainplan_subfeature.md\r\n   - mainplan_subfeature_checklist.md \r\n   - mainplan_subfeature_context.yaml\r\nSYSTEM 3. Reference format in main plan:\r\n   <!-- SUBPLAN:mainplan_subfeature -->\r\n   [Subplan: Subfeature Name](mainplan_subfeature.md)\r\n   <!-- END_SUBPLAN -->\r\nSYSTEM 4. Add to main checklist: - [ ] Complete subfeature implementation\r\nSYSTEM 5. Subplan checklists need:\r\n   - Atomic tasks with - [ ] checkboxes\r\n   - Implementation-specific details\r\n   - Clear dependency markers\r\nSYSTEM 6. Ensure the main plan checklist properly delegates actual implementation to the subplans\r\n            SYSTEM Create separate checklist and context.yaml files for the main plan and each subplan to track the progress of implementing the plan.            \r\n            SYSTEM For the context.yaml, consider all provided files and add relevant files to the affected context.yaml.\r\n            SYSTEM Only proceed with changes after creating and committing the plan files.\r\n            SYSTEM Ensure that you stick to the defined editing format when creating or editing files, e.g. only have the filepath above search blocks.\r\n< STRUCTURED MODE> i want to create a fancy ui app for basic keycloak functionality like creating users and assigning roles.\r\nthe app should consist of a server (spring boot 3 backend) with a reactjs frontend\r\nthe compiled frontend should be served by the backend as well as a wrapper api that proxies to keycloaks apis\r\ndefine or modify gradle tasks that will use a node gradle plugin to build the frontend and bundle it in the backend jar\r\nideally the bootRun task will run a function backend with contained frontent\r\ndevelopers working with the project should only have to install a suitable jdk, the gradle wrapper  gradle plugins will ensure all other dev dependencies are provided\r\nthere is no need for global npm or gradle setup </STRUCTURED MODE>\r\nSYSTEM Make sure to commit the creation of all plan files and don't start the implementation. \r\nSYSTEM Never ask Would you like me to proceed with the initial implementation steps?\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nInstead of actually creating the files, it wants to add an unrelated file (that gets confirmed by -y) and proceeds to basically start  over. I know it's lengthy and not the ideal minimal example but here is the chat history [aider.chat.history_excerpt.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18218648/aider.chat.history_excerpt.md)\r\nIs this a failed edit format?\r\n\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider v0.69.1\r\nMain model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 with diff edit format, infinite output\r\n",

The motivating reasons for this are:\r\n\r\n### For regular use\r\n- If Aider missed a file change, either due to the comment written during aider [processing]( https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/2717) or if the comment was written prior to Aider startup, users can trigger Aider to explicitly process a file\r\n- Improve Aider's performance by not using `--watch-files` (or excluding various large files) so that Aider doesn't need to search those files on each write but instead can be told to explicitly process those file's comments when prompted by this command.\r\n\r\n### For plugin integration\r\n- If a plugin is auto-starting Aider when detecting qualifying comments (as is the case with this Neovim [plugin](https://github.com/aweis89/aider.nvim)), it can tell Aider to process a file with comments written prior to Aider's startup.\r\n- Plugins can send files with valid comments to Aider so that Aider doesn't need to watch files and search them on each write. This has the advantage of providing more control to plugins for triggering commands before and after the processing. (It also has the potential to improve performance when done on the plugin side, e.x. using already parsed files with treesitter to get comments and using write hooks instead of file watches).\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\nPractically every input that I make to Aider is multi-line.  In many other systems, for example, Mathematica or Sage, the default when pressing the Enter key is to simply insert a new line and not submit a query or statement to the backend.  If one wishes to submit the current input, then they must press down Control, or Shift, or (in this case) Meta while pressing the Enter key.  \r\n\r\nSince the vast majority of the time I'm hitting Enter simply to get to the next line to separate elements of my input, it's often the case that I press enter mistakenly, which in my case costs me between 5 to 25 cents each time.\r\n\r\nSo, I would like a way to set the default to be that Enter does not submit the current input buffer, but rather simply moves to the next line to allow for multi-line editing, requiring a modifier to send the input buffer for processing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a reminder to submit via Alt-Enter could be put on the terminal prompt if this behaviour is unintuitive.\r\n\r\nThank you for such a great product!\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Typically something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Define a tuple type for user addresses\r\nUserAddress = Tuple[str, str, str, str, str]  # Example: (street, city, state, zip, country)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\n```\r\n> /settings\r\n\r\nAider v0.68.0\r\nMain model: gpt-4o with diff edit format\r\nWeak model: gpt-4o-mini\r\nGit repo: .git with 406 files\r\nRepo-map: using 1024 tokens, auto refresh\r\nCommand Line Args:   --model gpt-4o --watch-files --no-fancy-input\r\nDefaults:\r\n  --set-env:         []\r\n  --api-key:         []\r\n  --model-settings-file:.aider.model.settings.yml\r\n  --model-metadata-file:.aider.model.metadata.json\r\n  --cache-keepalive-pings:0\r\n  --map-refresh:     auto\r\n  --map-multiplier-no-files:2\r\n  --input-history-file:/home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.aider.input.history\r\n  --chat-history-file:/home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.aider.chat.history.md\r\n  --user-input-color:#00cc00\r\n  --tool-error-color:#FF2222\r\n  --tool-warning-color:#FFA500\r\n  --assistant-output-color:#0088ff\r\n  --code-theme:      default\r\n  --aiderignore:     /home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.aiderignore\r\n  --lint-cmd:        []\r\n  --test-cmd:        []\r\n  --voice-format:    wav\r\n  --voice-language:  en\r\n  --encoding:        utf-8\r\n  --env-file:        /home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.env\r\n\r\nOption settings:\r\n  - aiderignore: /home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.aiderignore\r\n  - alias: None\r\n  - analytics: None\r\n  - analytics_disable: False\r\n  - analytics_log: None\r\n  - anthropic_api_key: None\r\n  - api_key: []\r\n  - apply: None\r\n  - apply_clipboard_edits: False\r\n  - assistant_output_color: #0088ff\r\n  - attribute_author: True\r\n  - attribute_commit_message_author: False\r\n  - attribute_commit_message_committer: False\r\n  - attribute_committer: True\r\n  - auto_commits: True\r\n  - auto_lint: True\r\n  - auto_test: False\r\n  - cache_keepalive_pings: 0\r\n  - cache_prompts: False\r\n  - chat_history_file: /home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.aider.chat.history.md\r\n  - chat_language: None\r\n  - check_update: True\r\n  - code_theme: default\r\n  - commit: False\r\n  - commit_prompt: None\r\n  - completion_menu_bg_color: None\r\n  - completion_menu_color: None\r\n  - completion_menu_current_bg_color: None\r\n  - completion_menu_current_color: None\r\n  - config: None\r\n  - copy_paste: False\r\n  - dark_mode: False\r\n  - detect_urls: True\r\n  - dirty_commits: True\r\n  - dry_run: False\r\n  - edit_format: None\r\n  - editor: None\r\n  - editor_edit_format: None\r\n  - editor_model: None\r\n  - encoding: utf-8\r\n  - env_file: /home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.env\r\n  - exit: False\r\n  - fancy_input: False\r\n  - file: None\r\n  - files: []\r\n  - git: True\r\n  - gitignore: True\r\n  - gui: False\r\n  - input_history_file: /home/elrond/Devo/tmp/aider/.aider.input.history\r\n  - install_main_branch: False\r\n  - just_check_update: False\r\n  - light_mode: False\r\n  - lint: False\r\n  - lint_cmd: []\r\n  - list_models: None\r\n  - llm_history_file: None\r\n  - load: None\r\n  - map_multiplier_no_files: 2\r\n  - map_refresh: auto\r\n  - map_tokens: None\r\n  - max_chat_history_tokens: None\r\n  - message: None\r\n  - message_file: None\r\n  - model: gpt-4o\r\n  - model_metadata_file: .aider.model.metadata.json\r\n  - model_settings_file: .aider.model.settings.yml\r\n  - openai_api_base: None\r\n  - openai_api_deployment_id: None\r\n  - openai_api_key: None\r\n  - openai_api_type: None\r\n  - openai_api_version: None\r\n  - openai_organization_id: None\r\n  - pretty: True\r\n  - read: None\r\n  - restore_chat_history: False\r\n  - set_env: []\r\n  - show_diffs: False\r\n  - show_model_warnings: True\r\n  - show_prompts: False\r\n  - show_release_notes: None\r\n  - show_repo_map: False\r\n  - skip_sanity_check_repo: False\r\n  - stream: True\r\n  - subtree_only: False\r\n  - suggest_shell_commands: True\r\n  - test: False\r\n  - test_cmd: []\r\n  - timeout: None\r\n  - tool_error_color: #FF2222\r\n  - tool_output_color: None\r\n  - tool_warning_color: #FFA500\r\n  - upgrade: False\r\n  - user_input_color: #00cc00\r\n  - verbose: False\r\n  - verify_ssl: True\r\n  - vim: False\r\n  - voice_format: wav\r\n  - voice_input_device: None\r\n  - voice_language: en\r\n  - watch_files: True\r\n  - weak_model: None\r\n  - yes_always: None\r\n```",

With editor-mode being diff, I find a great benefit to architect mode is the improvement of code formatting correctness. For example, as a baseline on my system, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct gives 92% cases well formed using diff editing, but using architect mode with both 32B model gives 100%. The same with 72B-Instruct version as the architect and 32B as editor. The same with 32B as architect and deepseek-coder as editor.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be worth exploring to make some improvements on diff editing. Given my limited tests, is this something you have encountered?\n\n### Version and model info\n\nAider 0.63.3.dev",

The \"oracle\" unit tests are only used during final scoring.\r\n\r\n1. Closer to real development - fornew features, there is no guarantee of the availability of \"oracle\" tests. Especially for complex problems, setting the test boundary is as challenging as implementing the features.\r\n2. Detect potential overfitting - we can ask an LLM judge, similar to MT-bench, to evaluate the similarity between the written tests and official unit tests. Higher similarity implies higher possibility of overfitting.\r\n\r\nWhat's your thoughts on this idea?

      "title": "Suggestion: Renaming the Project.",
      "body": "### Great Work\r\n\r\nThank you very much for creating this great tool 👍 I have a suggestion for the project. \r\n\r\nThe name of a project is a vital aspect of its identity, particularly for open-source initiatives like \"Aider,\" an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline coding tasks. While the current name reflects the essence of helping, it presents several challenges in branding, discoverability, and differentiation. Here’s why renaming this project is worth considering and how it could improve its impact.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **1. \"Aider\" Is Too Generic and Non-Specific**\r\nThe term \"Aider\" is a straightforward derivative of \"aid,\" which is widely used and lacks uniqueness. While simplicity is often beneficial, overly general names can dilute a project’s identity. In this case:\r\n   - It does not immediately convey that the project is an **AI assistant tailored for coding**.\r\n   - The generic nature makes it harder for the name to evoke a clear or strong association with its purpose in users’ minds.\r\n\r\nA more specific or creative name can help the project stand out and resonate with its intended audience—developers and AI enthusiasts.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **2. Challenges in Online Discoverability**\r\nIn the digital era, **search engine optimization (SEO)** is critical. A project name like \"Aider\" faces distinct disadvantages in discoverability:\r\n   - **Search Saturation**: Generic words like \"aid\" or \"aider\" are widely used in various unrelated contexts, such as healthcare, charity, and everyday language. Searching for \"Aider AI coding\" may still bring unrelated results.\r\n   - **Competing Terms**: The project might compete for visibility with existing tools, definitions, or organizations using similar terms, lowering its SEO ranking.\r\n\r\nChoosing a more unique and descriptive name could address these challenges and make it easier for developers and contributors to find the project online.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **3. Missed Branding Opportunities**\r\nOpen-source projects thrive on community involvement, recognition, and emotional connection. The name \"Aider,\" while functional, does not fully encapsulate the innovative nature or focus of the project. A stronger name can:\r\n   - Highlight the project’s **AI-driven capabilities**.\r\n   - Showcase its relevance to **coding and software development**.\r\n   - Create a memorable identity that fosters recognition and community engagement.\r\n\r\nFor instance, names like \"CodeMate,\" \"DevHelper,\" or \"AIderCoder\" combine clarity, purpose, and creativity, immediately signaling the project’s core functionality to its audience.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **4. Potential for Global Reach**\r\nOpen-source projects are inherently global, and the name \"Aider\" may not translate well across different cultures and languages:\r\n   - **Linguistic Challenges**: In some languages, the term \"aider\" might not carry the same meaning or might even confuse non-English-speaking users.\r\n   - **Cultural Relevance**: A name that is more universally appealing and tied to technology or AI coding could increase the project’s accessibility and adoption worldwide.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **5. Industry Standards and Trends**\r\nIn the world of open-source and tech projects, unique, targeted names have proven more effective in building a strong identity. Examples like **\"GitHub,\" \"TensorFlow,\"** and **\"PyTorch\"** demonstrate how innovative names can combine functionality with branding. These names are:\r\n   - **Distinctive**: Avoiding generic terms ensures higher search visibility.\r\n   - **Descriptive**: Often allude to the project’s purpose or core technology.\r\n   - **Memorable**: Easily recognizable, aiding in community-driven growth.\r\n\r\nRenaming \"Aider\" to something similarly distinctive and descriptive could help the project align with industry standards and trends.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Suggestions for a New Name**\r\nTo align with the project’s purpose as an AI assistant for coding, consider these naming strategies:\r\n   - **Highlight AI and Coding**: Examples include \"CodeBot,\" \"AIderCoder,\" or \"CodeCatalyst.\"\r\n   - **Combine Creativity with Functionality**: Names like \"SyntaxSmith,\" \"DevGenie,\" or \"AutoCode\" balance innovation and clarity.\r\n   - **Leverage Uniqueness**: Invented words or hybrid names like \"CodeAIder,\" \"CogniCode,\" or \"DevNova\" ensure originality and searchability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Suggestion**\r\nRenaming \"Aider\" to a more specific and distinctive name is a strategic decision that can benefit the project in multiple ways: improved online visibility, stronger branding, and broader global appeal. A carefully chosen name can reflect the project’s AI-driven purpose, its open-source nature, and its focus on empowering developers, ultimately fostering greater recognition, engagement, and growth.\r\n",

However, taking advantage of the incredible existing functionality of `aider`, and only focusing on the Neovim integration parts, enables easily building a plugin that surpasses them all.

Even when I try to correct it manually, the file name doesn’t change. This seems like a programming error!\r\n\r\nVersion and Model Info:\r\nAider Version: 0.66.0\r\nModels in Use: Architect (GPT-4.0) and Anthropic models (likely for context-based tasks)\r\nI don’t think this is related to the model being used, but it's a critical issue that needs attention.\r\n\r\nDoes that capture your issue accurately?
