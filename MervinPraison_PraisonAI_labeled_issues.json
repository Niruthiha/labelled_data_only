      "body": "Hi Mervin,\r\n\r\nI’ve been working with the praisonai code tool and found it immensely helpful for coding with a large context base. Great work on developing such a robust tool! I have a couple of enhancements to propose that could streamline the user experience and repo organization:\r\n\r\n- **Directory Management**:\r\n  - Currently, files like `chainlit.md` and the `.chainlit` directory are placed in the root of the repository upon startup. The `public` directory also adds to the clutter.\r\n  - It would be more efficient to relocate these to `~/.praison/`, alongside `database.sqlite`. This would help keep the root directory clean and organized.\r\n\r\n- **Docker Integration**:\r\n  - Adding Docker support could significantly simplify setting up and running the tool across different environments.\r\n  - Dockerization would ensure a more isolated and consistent operational environment, facilitating easier deployment and scalability.\r\n  - **Increased Adoption**: Dockerizing the application can lower the barrier to entry for new users, enabling more developers to test the tool. This increased user base can provide more feedback, potentially increase your follower base, and further enhance the toolset through community contributions.\r\n\r\nThese changes could help maintain the tool’s efficiency while improving its usability and setup process.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering these suggestions. Looking forward to your thoughts!\r\n",
