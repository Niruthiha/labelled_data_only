      "body": "SuperAGI is built with a variety of tools that an agent can utilize based on its evaluation of the current situation. However, there is a gap when it comes to dynamic user interaction. This issue proposes the addition of a UserFeedback tool which the agent could invoke when it requires more information or guidance from the user.\r\n\r\nIn its current state, SuperAGI allows for different operational modes, such as \"God Mode\" for fully autonomous operation, and \"Restricted Mode\" which seeks user permissions before executing any tool. The UserInteraction tool would add a new dimension to this, allowing the agent to operate autonomously (like \"God Mode\") while also having the capability to actively seek user input at key milestones or decision points.\r\n\r\nThis would provide a more dynamic interaction model, enabling the agent to adapt to changing requirements or unexpected scenarios more effectively. It would also enhance the agent's ability to align with user expectations and objectives, making it a more versatile and useful tool for developers. The proposed UserInteraction tool could be integrated into the existing SuperAGI framework and made available for the agent to select as needed, just like the other tools currently at its disposal.",

      "body": "I'm running into issues getting SuperAGI to actually execute a Python script.\r\n\r\nHere is an example agent with 3 goals:\r\n\r\n1. Write a python script to write \"Hello World\" to a .txt file. Save the .py file. Do not write any comments and make sure new lines and the format of the .py file are correct.\r\n\r\n2. Execute the .py file and don't consider the task as finished until the .txt file exists\r\n\r\n3. Read the contents of the .txt file and print to console\r\n\r\nThe agent has access to the `CodingTool`, `Read File`, and `Write File`, but it tells me the following:\r\n```\r\nThoughts: Since I cannot directly execute the script, I will provide detailed instructions for the user.\r\nPlan: - Provide instructions to execute the .py file\r\n- Read the contents of the .txt file and print to console\r\nCriticism: None\r\nTool: ThinkingTool\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt correctly creates the `hello_world.py` file and when I manually execute it the result is correct, but not sure why SuperAGI is unable to execute the script itself. In some of my earlier experiments it was actually executing the python code and it was getting a \"could not parse invalid json\" on a more complex script (like what was reported in issue #187), but seemed to clearly run the code. Any tips around getting it to execute code directly?\r\n\r\nI also think it would be useful to start an FAQ for things like this. If you could provide input here I'd be happy to kick-off an FAQ and add this in. Thank you for creating such an amazing tool 🔥",

      "body": "Thank you for the project, it works great so far! :)\r\n\r\nOne thing I was wondering while setting up the project was why Pinecone is the vector DB of choice here.\r\n\r\nI have zero knowledge about vector DBs and so it seems odd to me that Pinecone is used here as a default as it only supports 1 index in free tier and rapidly rises to 70$ / month for more indicies which might throw off some potential users of this project. There seem to be open source options out there that could even be integrated into the docker-compose setup. For example [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus).\r\n\r\nThe code also looks ready to support different databases.\r\n\r\nAs I said I have zero experience with vector DBs, so please excuse me if I'm asking dumb questions.\r\nRegardless, my questions are:\r\n\r\n1. Why did you choose Pinecone?\r\n2. Would Milvus work for the use case?\r\n3. Would the integration really be as simple as implementing a `Milvus` class with two methods just like the `vector_store/Pinecone` class and adding support for it in the `VectorFactory`? (and supply the desired DB driver from all usages of the `VectorFactory`)\r\n4. Wouldn't it make sense to use an open source DB as the default to be easier to set up for new users? \r\n\r\nThanks for your answer!",

Why is there redis configuration options in config.yaml?\r\nYou didn't document anything about how to setup this with anything other than Pinecone, which now I can't use because they put me in a waitlist.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate what you've done so far, but I really don't understand how can I use it. I have a ready Redis instance, with no password authentication, all defaults and it works, now I need to know how to integrate SuperAGI with it.\r\nI can see there are some parameters to connect to Redis, but I have no idea how to use them, for example, the password field- if there is no password, then an empty string (\"\") ? And what is PostgreSQL doing there? Isn't it either Pinecone or Redis?\r\n\r\nPlease explain further, it's really frustrating.",

Write word document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRAINTS:\r\n1. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\r\n2. Ensure the command and args are as per current plan and reasoning\r\n3. Exclusively use the tools listed in double quotes e.g. \"tool name\"\r\n4. REMEMBER to format your response as JSON, using double quotes (\"\") around keys and string values, and commas (,) to separate items in arrays and objects. IMPORTANTLY, to use a JSON object as a string in another JSON object, you need to escape the double quotes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS:\r\n1.

It will serve as a blueprint for the development team and ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the app's scope and objectives.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the validation error in the previous tool response, the missing field \"spec_file_name\" needs to be provided as an argument to the WriteSpecTool. This field should contain the name of the specification file that will be generated by the tool.\r\n\r\nExample command to use the WriteSpecTool:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteSpecTool --task_description \"Specification task description.\" --spec_file_name \"specification.docx\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy providing the missing field and executing the WriteSpecTool, we can generate the required specification for the app, which will serve as a foundation for further development and testing.\r\nschedule-icon\r\n42 minutes ago\r\n💡\r\nThoughts: By assessing the project's needs and prioritizing tasks, I can make an informed decision about which tool to use next.\r\nPlan: - Review the project's objectives and tasks\r\n- Identify the most pressing task\r\n- Determine the tool that will help accomplish the task\r\nCriticism: I need to ensure that I carefully consider the priority and feasibility of each task before deciding on the next tool to use.\r\nTool:\r\nschedule-icon\r\n42 minutes ago\r\n🛠️\r\nCOMPLETE\r\nschedule-icon\r\n42 minutes ago\r\n🏁\r\nAll goals completed successfully!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt just stopped all of a sudden.

Particularly concerning is the database password which is set as \"password\". This design restricts users from setting their own security credentials.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nThe Docker image should not contain any hardcoded credentials, allowing users to specify their own, especially for security-sensitive components like database passwords.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nFor now, users can create a copy of the affected configuration file and bind it as a volume in the Docker Compose setup.\r\n```yaml\r\nvolumes:\r\n      - \"./alembic.ini:/app/alembic.ini\"  \r\n```\r\n\r\nSee error log:\r\n```\r\npsycopg2.OperationalError: could not translate host name \"super__postgres\" to address: Temporary failure in name resolution\r\n``` \n\n### How to replicate your Issue?\n\nTo reproduce the issue, follow the steps in the instructions at: https://hub.docker.com/r/superagidev/superagi.\r\nBefore starting, replace the database connection credentials with your own in  `docker-compose.yaml` and `config.yaml`.\n\n### Upload Error Log Content\n\npsycopg2.OperationalError: could not translate host name \"super__postgres\" to address: Temporary failure in name resolution",

Had to search through discord to find that the fix is to \"update changes\" in the settings in the UI.\r\n\r\nI'm not a dev so I can't fix this but it should be simple for a dev to do. It's a shame for new users to have to troubleshoot the first thing they do. I understand that these things get overlooked because the devs will probably rarely do a clean new install and read through the setup steps to get it working so I thought that I'd create my first issue on github to help this project be more appealing to new users.\n\n### How to replicate your Issue?\n\nJust follow the setup steps in the readme from a clean install and try to run the agent, you'll see that you can't pick a model without updating the changes in settings in the UI.\n\n### Upload Error Log Content\n\nDon't have an error log but must type something here to submit issue",
