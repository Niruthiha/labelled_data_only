      "title": "Refactor `App` Class in `app.py` for Streamlined Code and Maintenance",
      "body": "### GitHub Issue: Refactoring the `App` Class in `app.py` for Enhanced Readability and Maintainability\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\nThe `App` class in `app.py` is central to our Nextpy application but currently handles an extensive range of functionalities, leading to complexity and potential maintainability issues. This issue aims to refactor `App` by effectively leveraging existing modules (`admin.py`, `event.py`, `state.py`) and improving code organization.\r\n\r\n#### Current State\r\n- The `App` class is multifaceted, combining numerous functionalities which complicates the codebase.\r\n\r\n#### Objective\r\n- Streamline the `App` class to efficiently utilize `admin.py`, `event.py`, and `state.py`.\r\n- Reduce redundancy and enhance code clarity.\r\n\r\n#### Proposal Details\r\n\r\n**1. Integration with Existing Modules:**\r\n- Thoroughly review and integrate `admin.py`, `event.py`, and `state.py` to offload respective functionalities from `App`.\r\n- Eliminate duplicate implementations in `App` that are already handled by these modules.\r\n\r\n**2. Streamlining Event Handling:**\r\n- Refine event handling in `App` using the structured approach defined in `event.py`.\r\n- Create a more intuitive interface between `App` and the event module for cleaner and more maintainable code.\r\n\r\n**3. State Management Refinement:**\r\n- Centralize state management responsibilities in `state.py`, and modify `App` to interact seamlessly with this module.\r\n- Simplify and clarify the state management processes within `App`.\r\n\r\n**4. Admin Dashboard Integration Enhancement:**\r\n- Extract and relocate admin dashboard setup (e.g., `setup_admin_dash`) to a dedicated class within `admin.py`.\r\n- Ensure this class handles all admin-related functionalities, providing a clean interface with `App`.\r\n\r\n**5. Code Cleanup and Optimization:**\r\n- Identify and refactor complex or redundant sections in `App`.\r\n- Focus on enhancing readability and execution efficiency.\r\n\r\n# TODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Step 1: Module Integration Review**\r\n  - Assess overlaps and interactions between `App` and the modules (`admin.py`, `event.py`, `state.py`), documenting the findings.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Step 2: Event Handling Refinement**\r\n  - Revise `App`'s event handling, aligning and integrating changes with `event.py`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Step 3: State Management Enhancement**\r\n  - Overhaul `App`'s state management in coordination with modifications in `state.py`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Step 4: Admin Dashboard Integration Refinement**\r\n  - Reorganize admin dashboard functionality from `App` to `admin.py`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Step 5: Code Cleanup and Refactoring**\r\n  - Execute comprehensive code refinement in `App`, focusing on simplification and optimization.\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Step 6: Testing and Validation**\r\n  - Confirm that refactoring retains existing functionality.\r\n  - Implement extensive testing to verify new code structures and performance.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Outcomes:\r\n- A more streamlined and readable `App` class.\r\n- Reduced code redundancy and improved integration with existing modules.\r\n- A well-organized and efficient codebase, facilitating future development and maintenance.\r\n\r\n#### Additional Notes:\r\n- Ensure backward compatibility and maintain core functionality post-refactoring.\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis issue aims to significantly enhance the Nextpy framework's `app.py` file, focusing on structural improvements and efficient use of existing resources. The end goal is a more maintainable, clear, and efficient codebase that continues to deliver robust functionality.",

      "title": "Improved logging in multiagent_manager",
      "body": "The issue:\n\nLogging in MultiagentManager currently uses print statements with a conditional variable passed as a parameter \"debug\" with the default value False. This is a temporary solution.\n\nThe solution:\n\nWhenever the conditional variable \"debug\" is checked, simply store the current logging level in a variable, set current logging to DEBUG, log the statement, then set the logging level back to its original state. This way if a user has previously not set the logging, they do not need to manually do it in their code, they can simply pass \"debug\"=True. This is also helpful when you have multiple managers but you only want to debug one of them.",

      "body": "\r\nWe could introduce `@xt.method` decorator in Nextpy for defining event handlers within state classes. This feature is intended to enhance code readability, standardize the declaration of methods handling state changes, and align with AI code generation practices.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nCurrently, Nextpy requires methods within state classes to be defined directly, without specific decorators. This approach is functional but does not distinguish between regular methods and event handlers explicitly designed to modify the state.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Behavior\r\nThe introduction of the `@xt.method` decorator would allow developers to clearly mark methods in the state class as event handlers. This not only improves code readability but also aligns with AI code generation patterns, where such decorators are often included by default. It could also facilitate additional framework optimizations or checks.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n@xt.method(ToDoState)\r\ndef delete_todo(state, todo):\r\n    state.todos.remove(todo)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n- **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability**: Clearly distinguishes state-modifying methods from regular class methods.\r\n- **Alignment with AI Code Generation**: Aligns with default practices of AI code generation tools, which often include method decorators in their outputs.\r\n",

      "title": "Enhance Tailwind CSS Plugin Support ",
      "body": "Currently, integrating certain Tailwind CSS plugins into Nextpy projects presents a significant challenge. This is primarily due to the limited customization options available within the `tailwind.config.js` setup. This limitation hinders the ability to fully exploit the capabilities of the Tailwind CSS ecosystem, consequently restricting design and functionality enhancements in Nextpy projects.\r\n\r\n**Specific Challenges:**\r\n- Difficulty in integrating Tailwind CSS plugins that require more complex setup than a simple require in `tailwind.config.js`.\r\n- The current setup within the Nextpy framework offers limited flexibility, particularly in terms of customizing the Tailwind CSS configuration.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Solutions:**\r\n1. **Template Customization:**\r\n   - Enhance the flexibility of the Jinja template (`tailwind.config.js.jinja2`) used in Nextpy. \r\n   - The enhancement should aim to accommodate a variety of plugin integration scenarios, allowing for more complex plugin configurations.\r\n\r\n2. **Custom Configuration Support:**\r\n   - Enable users to provide their own `tailwind.config.js` file.\r\n   - Alternatively, allow the use of a custom Jinja template for `tailwind.css`. \r\n   - This would grant users greater control and versatility in terms of plugin integration and configuration.\r\n\r\n**Expected Outcome:**\r\nImplementing these solutions will significantly improve the ease of integrating diverse Tailwind CSS plugins into Nextpy projects.

      "title": "Feature Proposal: Enhanced Single-File Execution in Any Directory Structure",
      "body": "#### **Current State**\r\n- nextpy's `run` command requires a predefined directory structure for execution.\r\n\r\n#### **Objective**\r\n- Enable users to execute individual files with `nextpy run`, regardless of the directory structure, similar to tools like Streamlit .\r\n\r\n#### **Proposal Details**\r\n\r\n**1. Command Enhancement:**\r\n- Modify `nextpy run` to primarily accept a file path:\r\n  - `-f` or `--file`: Path to the target file (relative or absolute).\r\n  - `-t` or `--theme`: Optional theme (defaults to standard if not provided).\r\n\r\n**2. Operational Logic:**\r\n- Ensure the file's existence at the given path.\r\n- Determine the file type (e.g., `.mdx`, `.py`) and execute accordingly.\r\n- For `.mdx` files, use the default MDX viewer, or apply the specified theme.\r\n- For `.py` files, execute the script in an isolated or appropriate environment.\r\n- Provide error messages and graceful exits for unsupported file types or execution errors.\r\n\r\n**3. Environment Independence:**\r\n- Eliminate dependency on a specific project structure.\r\n- Set up the necessary minimal environment based on the file type.\r\n- Allow environment variables or configurations to be specified via command line or external config files for flexibility.\r\n\r\n**4. Theme Integration and Default Viewer:**\r\n- Same as previously proposed.\r\n\r\n#### **Sample Usage:**\r\n\r\n**Run a File in Any Directory:**\r\n```bash\r\n$ nextpy run -f /path/to/file.mdx\r\n$ nextpy run -f ./relative/path/to/script.py\r\n```\r\n**With Custom Theme:**\r\n```bash\r\n$ nextpy run -f /path/to/file.mdx -t bespoke_theme\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **Resultant Execution:**\r\n- Executing this command will focus on the specified file only, setting up a minimal environment as required.\r\n- The command will be independent of the directory structure, allowing flexibility in file organization.\r\n\r\n#### **Advantages:**\r\n- Streamlines the process of running individual files, making it more accessible and flexible.\r\n- Reduces the necessity for a comprehensive initial setup, facilitating quick testing and prototyping.\r\n- Enhances the user experience, particularly beneficial for new users and in educational contexts.\r\n\r\n#### **Implementation Considerations:**\r\n- Robust error handling and informative messaging for user guidance.\r\n- Extensive testing with various file locations and types to ensure reliability.\r\n- Documentation updates to guide users on new command usage and capabilities.\r\n\r\n#### **Potential Directory Structure Post-Execution:**\r\n```bash\r\n.any_directory\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ executed_file.mdx (or .py, etc.)\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ .web (if necessary for execution)\r\nâ””â”€â”€ other_files_or_directories (unrelated to nextpy execution)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Requirements Analysis\r\n- [ ] Analyze the current functionality of the `nextpy run` command.\r\n- [ ] Identify the limitations with respect to directory structure dependence.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Design Command Enhancements\r\n- [ ] Design the new command line interface to accept a file path (`-f` or `--file`) and an optional theme (`-t` or `--theme`).\r\n- [ ] Plan how the command will handle different file types (e.g., `.mdx`, `.py`).\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Update Command Line Interface\r\n- [ ] Modify the `run` command in Typer to accept the file path as a primary argument.\r\n- [ ] Implement the logic to parse and handle the optional theme argument.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Implement File Detection and Execution Logic\r\n- [ ] Develop a function to validate the existence of the specified file.\r\n- [ ] Create a function to determine the file type based on the file extension or content.\r\n- [ ] Implement the execution logic for `.mdx` files, including using the default MDX viewer or the specified theme.\r\n- [ ] Implement the execution logic for `.py` files, ensuring they run correctly irrespective of the directory structure.\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Environment Setup\r\n- [ ] Establish a minimal environment setup required for the execution of the specified file.\r\n- [ ] Ensure environment variable or configuration can be set externally if required.\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Testing and Quality Assurance\r\n- [ ] Conduct unit testing for new functionalities.\r\n- [ ] Perform integration testing to ensure the new command works seamlessly with existing features.\r\n- [ ] Test the command with various file types and in different directory structures.\r\n\r\n### Step 7: Error Handling and User Feedback\r\n- [ ] Implement robust error handling for unsupported file types, missing files, and execution errors.\r\n- [ ] Develop user-friendly error messages and guidance for troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### Step 8: Documentation and Examples\r\n- [ ] Update the project documentation to include the new command usage.\r\n- [ ] Provide example use cases and command line inputs in the documentation.",
