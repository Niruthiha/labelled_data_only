Docker-compose (and docker stop) will initially send `SIGTERM` to process 1 in the container, but after 10 seconds if the primary container process hasn't ended it will then forcefully destroy the container.  https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/stop/\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. `docker-compose-up` with a compose file that includes `ollama`, `searxng`, and `deep-research`.\n2. Wait for everything to load and work properly.\n3. `docker-compose stop`\n4. Notice that it takes just over 10 seconds to stop every time.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe container cleanly ends in under 10 seconds so that it doesn't get hard terminated by docker-compose.\n\n**System Information:**\n - OS: Windows, WSL2, Ubuntu 22\n - Python Version: Docker\n - Model Used: Qwen3:30b-a3b\n - Hardware Specs: nVidia RTX 5090\n",

The Compose Manager plugin in Unraid supports docker-compose.yml files but users don't know how to handle the separate Dockerfile in this environment.\n\n## Impact\nThis prevents Unraid users from successfully deploying Local Deep Research.\n\n## Suggested Solutions\n1. Create an Unraid-specific setup guide in the documentation\n2. Modify the docker-compose.yml to use pre-built images rather than building from a Dockerfile\n3. Create a single-file docker-compose.yml that includes the build instructions inline\n\n## Additional Context\nFrom a user report:\n> I use the Compose Manager plugin in Unraid, so that I can add docker container with a compose file, but I have never used a dockerfile. I have no idea how to use that in combination with Unraid and chatgpt didnt know either, so I gave up 😅\n\n## Proposed Priority\nMedium - This affects a specific subset of users but completely blocks their usage of the application.",

From LDR log: SearXNG returned status code 400. \nExcept for Searxng status code 400, everything else seems fine in LDR log. The model went on to generate the summary template without any search results.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThere should be results from Searxng, which will be used to generate the report.\n\n**System Information:**\n- Docker Desktop on Windows 11\n- Run with existing Ollama container at http://ollama:11434\n- Run with existing Searxng container at http://host.docker.internal:8081 \n- Both Ollama and Searxng instance addresses are configured properly in LDR Settings.\n\n**Additional context**\nRunning the exact query seen in LDR's log directly in Searxng returns several results. I also use this Searxng instance with Open WebUI without any issues. This is unlikely to be an issue with Searxng instance.\nI have tried disabling Safe Search in LDR's setting, but still got the same issue.\n\n**Output/Logs from Searxng**\n```\n2025-05-13 23:47:48.106

Perform a quick summary with a particular query\n3. Perform another quick summary with the same query\n4. Go to the history view, and select the first search.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe outputs from both searches should be preserved.\n\n**System Information:**\n - OS: Ubuntu 22.04\n - Python Version: 3.12.0\n - Model Used: llama-3.3-70b-instruct\n - Hardware Specs: 32 GB RAM, no GPU\n\n**Additional context**\nI suspect that this has to do with the naming of report files in the outputs directory. I notice that it is named based on the query. The problem is probably that newer searches with the same query are overwriting the older files.\n",

I run this short example from the documentation modifying the from statement to use .api. I am using the same settings.toml and .env file as when i run ldr-web.\nhere is the applicable/modified [llm] section in settings.toml\n```\n[llm]\nprovider = \"openai_endpoint\"\n# Model name\nmodel = \"deepseek-chat\"  #reasoner\"\n# Temperature\ntemperature = 1.0\n# Maximum tokens\nmax_tokens = 30000\n# OpenAI-compatible endpoint URL\nopenai_endpoint_url = \"https://api.deepseek.com\"\n```\nand here is the example I'm trying to run  using programtic access:\n```\n# Generate a quick research summary with custom parameters\nresults = quick_summary(\n    query=\"advances in fusion energy\",\n    search_tool=\"auto\",          # Auto-select the best search engine\n    iterations=1,                # Single research cycle for speed\n    questions_per_iteration=2,   # Generate 2 follow-up questions\n    max_results=30,              # Consider up to 30 search results\n    temperature=0.7,              # Control creativity of generation\n    progress_callback=print\n)\nprint(results[\"summary\"])\n```\n2. See error:\nError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Incorrect API key provided: <<removed>>. You can find your API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nopenai_endpoint_url = \"https://api.deepseek.com\" should be used an not the openai endpoint.\n\n**System Information:**\n - OS: Ubuntu 24.04\n - Python Version: 3.10.0\n - Model Used: deepseek-chat\n\n\n**Additional context**\nI do not have an understanding of the full code base so I  state the following as an observation only.   \n\nI compared my working setup from a month ago where I run ldr-web from and I noticed a different llm_config.py between then and now.\n\na quick look and i see this commit Commit 6cb2137 where it made this change to llm_config.py:\n```\n-        openai_endpoint_url = settings.llm.openai_endpoint_url\n+         if openai_endpoint_url is not None:\n+             openai_endpoint_url = get_db_setting(\n+                 \"llm.openai_endpoint_url\", settings.llm.openai_endpoint_url\n+             )\n```\nwhen  debug and step through and I undo this change and removing the 4 lines and just leave the previous line \n```\n openai_endpoint_url = settings.llm.openai_endpoint_url\n```\nthen the example script above runs successfully.\n\n",

Run command 'Quick Search' \n2. Enter query 'who is napoleon ?'\n3. Search went successfully, cheers, then i want download the pdf file\n\n**Expected behavior**\ngenerated pdf file size 102.5Mb ! \nAlso some texts seems to be rendered as images.\n\nBy getting query markdown answer directly from browser console and pull it in a markdown that i export myself to pdf i get a normal 115Kb sized file\n\n**System Information:**\n - OS: [e.g. Arch Linux Kernel Zen 6.1.3]\n - Python Version: [e.g. 3.13.2]\n - Model Used: [e.g. gemma1:3b]\n - Hardware Specs: [e.g. 32GB RAM, i9 9900k]\n\n\n",
