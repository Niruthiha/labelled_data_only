      "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen asked to produce a mathematical formula, Discord cannot correctly parse the character of the dot operator(multiplication), leading to messy and difficult to interpret output.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n1. Ask GPT to produce a formula or math expression which contains multiplication. In Discord, this will be formatted as '\\cdot'\r\n2. See screenshot for comparison between ChatGPT Web(left) and Discord(right)\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nI do not believe Discord can handle the native formatting, so a way to convert it to readable symbols would be nice. I'm not fully sure what the best method for this would be for Discord's Markdown.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://github.com/Kav-K/GPTDiscord/assets/23362597/19815e15-35d8-46f9-ad56-bef4491acb6e)\r\n",

      "body": "Currently if you converse with gpt vision, it will always interpret if you want to draw something or  not using a separate API call, this is a second API call and they're costly so we want to be able to turn it off, but better yet, we want to be able to just remove the second API call\r\n\r\nI was a bit (lot) stupid when designing this initially, we can avoid the second api call by just putting some instructions in the system pretext that ask it to use some sort of special syntax to denote a drawing prompt when it responds to a user if it picks up on intent to draw, and then we would just kick off the drawing from there onward, removing the api call entirely. This also increases conversation speed.\r\n\r\nAll the scaffolding for drawing is already in the code, what needs to be done is:\r\n- the LLM api call that evaluates the last few messages of history just needs to be removed \r\n- Some pretext needs to be created that can get gpt to respond with some sort of syntax when it picks up a users intent to draw for example you can try being like \r\n```\r\nIf the user wants to draw something, retain a prompt for what the user wants to draw such that it can go into a generator such as DALL-E, and after responding to the user message, type the prompt for what to draw within a special sequence of characters: #%^c, for example, #%^a dog#%^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis drawing syntax pretext would have to be appended programmatically and not just in the main text of the pretext because it should work for other openers too. There should be some sort of recurring system message every X messages that acts as a reminder to do this identification of drawing intent, and in the future we can expand our agent's capabilities further on this basis \r\n\r\nThere are some drawbacks to this, the independent evaluator system should theoretically be more accurate, as it is more focused without the entire conversation context.",

If using FakeYou, the voice would be selected in the settings. Since there are various limits (depending on purchased tier) to the durations of each audio clip generated by FakeYou, you would need to estimate the duration of the audio and break it into segments. \r\n\r\nIt would be most ideal to have a settable word or phrase to trigger the statement being sent to GPT such a name or something like \"GPT tell me\". \r\n",

This issue occurs unexpectedly and disrupts the user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set up the the Discord BOT.\r\n2. Use the 'internet chat' feature.\r\n3. Observe the agent randomly stopping at times due to iteration limit or time limit.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe agent should not stop unexpectedly and should be able to fix itself. \r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 22.04\r\n- Specs: 97GB RAM, RTX 4090\r\n- Packages: Latest versions\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if this issue could be investigated and resolved.

Yes, I can produce images, and I can even display them. I'm using the Markdown syntax to show the image, so it won't be displayed until you actually insert the image. If you'd like, I can upload the image to an image hosting site such as Imgur or Photobucket and provide you with a link to the image.

      "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWhile I think the translations of GPT3 are correct in content, they often seem too edgy and clinical to me. Which somehow doesn't fit to a bot, which tries to get as close as possible to a human interlocutor.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to have the best possible and most accurate human-like translation.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nDeepL is apparently currently the best translator. With really fascinating results.\r\n\r\n**Additional context** (Sorry for that copycat down there... Dx)\r\n- Unlike other services, the neural networks of DeepL can detect even the smallest nuances and reflect them in the translation. Not only does DeepL achieve record results in scientific benchmarks, but in blind tests translators also prefer the results of DeepL three times more often than those of the competition.\r\n\r\n* When using DeepL Pro, your data is protected with the highest security measures. We guarantee DeepL Pro subscribers that all texts are deleted immediately after the translation has been completed, and that the connection to our servers is always encrypted. This means that your texts are not used for any purposes other than your translation, nor can they be accessed by third parties.\r\n\r\n+ With DeepL Pro, you can translate an entire document with one click. All fonts, images, and formatting remain in place, leaving you free to edit the translated document any way you like.\r\n\r\n- It can translate your Microsoft Word (.docx), PowerPoint (.pptx), PDF (.pdf), and text (.txt) files. Further formats coming soon!\r\n\r\n* If you sign up for the DeepL API plan, you will be able to integrate DeepL’s JSON-based REST API into your own products and platforms. This allows you to incorporate the world’s best machine translation technology into a variety of new applications. For example, a company could have their international service enquiries instantly translated by DeepL Pro, greatly simplifying business procedures and improving customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n+ Freelance translators, translation agencies, language service providers, or corporate language departments can all benefit from using DeepL Pro, the world’s best machine translation technology, in their CAT Tool.\r\n\r\n[DeepL - Translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator)\r\n[DeepL - Press](https://www.deepl.com/press)\r\n[DeepL - ProAPI](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api/)\r\n[Why using DeepL instead of other translators?](https://www.deepl.com/whydeepl/)",

I'm also mindful of conversation history and try to be consistent with my answers. Oh, and I'm always up for chatting about coding, too – I'm good at providing code examples and explanations! 🤓\r\n\r\nHalf of the mentioned attributes are instructions to the bot, and not really descriptions of its personality.

Build the conversation up to around 1000-2000 tokens\r\n3. Continue until the context limit fails, which you should see happen before 4000 tokens are really used.\r\n4. \r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe conversation should only end if we attempt to send more than 4000 tokens in a prompt\r\n\r\n",
