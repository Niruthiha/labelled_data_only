Go to 'local-ai-packaged'\n2. run 'python start_services.py --profile gpu-amd'\n3. \"first stage\" of setup runs fine but when supabase gets cleared and everything gets rebuilt I receive the error. \n\n## Expected Behavior\nI would expect that vector would properly create the .yml file it is looking for.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nThe logs state that it is creating the .yml as a directory.\n\n## Screenshots\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa020760-d34e-4b64-9abb-86a340f28f4d)\n\n## Environment\n - OS: [linux - garuda - arch]\n - Using podman with podman-docker\n\n## Additional Context\nAdd any other context about the problem here, such as:\n- Does this happen consistently or intermittently? Consistently\n- Were there any recent changes that might be related? None that I can think of.\n- Any workarounds you've discovered? I have not discovered any solutions but I have checked for this issue. Solution https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/26362#discussioncomment-9513623 did not fix this for me.\n\nI have other issues as well but I think this one might be the cause of the others so I am starting with it.\n\nThank you for your assistance and patience. I will try not to drink dumbdumb juice today. <3",

This would function similarly to cloud, but still be local.\n\n## User Impact\nProvides more flexibility for accessing AI services from remote locations on the same network. (i.e. use n8n from laptop on the couch/bed/etc.)\n\n## Implementation Details (optional)\nIt seems like the introduction of the \"profiles\" has solidified this project as something which is intended to be hosted on the same machine you plan to access the web services from. I would suggest adding an additional profile which provides more flexibility to host the services through the docker host gateway.\n\n## Additional context\nAs an alternative, you could maintain alternate branches in git to host a version of the project which is supports headless configurations.",

Also you are limited to a single \"project\" per supabase stack so even though you can create new tables and schema for various services in the same supabase, you cant have multiple seperate databases isolated fom each other in the same supabase stack. the solution is to setup sub stacks on isolated docker networks bridged to the main netowork, one for each seperate database you need.\n\nlike you i also use Docker desktop in windows with WSL2 integration, for this I got my free 3 node Portainer BE license and set that up in WSL, this gives me intricate stack and docker  network controls",

      "body": "I'm currently setting up a Portainer-managed local Supabase and AI stack. I'm new to this, so if anything looks off, feel free to disregard or correct!\n\nA couple things I’ve run into:\nSupabase and Portainer don't play well together when using depends_on with healthchecks.\nSome services (notably vector) may report as unhealthy and block startup if your hardware is slower or the service just takes longer to initialize. This is a Docker Compose limitation that Portainer exposes more obviously. I've just created the supabase stuff outside of portainer for now, but I think this is solvable. \n\nAs pointed out [here](https://github.com/coleam00/local-ai-packaged/issues/58) Port 8000 (used by Kong) conflicts with Portainer.\nLuckily, Supabase allows this to be customized using KONG_HTTP_PORT in your .env file. Adjusting the Kong port is safer than trying to change Portainer’s internal setup (IMHO).\n\nPostgres container conflict across Compose files.\nBoth the Supabase and Local-AI Compose files spin up a postgres service, which will conflict if you run them on the same Docker host. You’ll either need to remove one of the postgres containers, or manually adjust ports and service names to avoid collisions\n\nShared network helps bridge Supabase and AI containers.\nI’m working around the isolation by assigning both Compose stacks to a custom local-ai Docker network. This makes it easier to reference containers across stacks. But it does require editing both Compose files, which isn’t ideal for widespread distribution.\n\nThat’s where I’m at! Still iterating on this and welcome any ideas or feedback.",

      "body": "## Describe the feature you'd like and why\nCurrently, the project setup relies on an installation script, which requires manual execution and increases deployment complexity. I propose adding a standalone docker-compose.yml file that allows users to deploy the project without running additional scripts.\n\nAdditionally, this change would replace Ollama with LiteLLM as the LLM backend. LiteLLM offers broader compatibility with multiple model providers, giving users more flexibility in choosing and managing LLMs.\n\nThis improvement would streamline deployment, reduce manual setup steps, and make the system more adaptable to different user needs.\n\n## User Impact\n- Developers & Self-Hosters: Would benefit from a simplified deployment process, reducing setup time and potential errors.\n- Users with different LLM providers: LiteLLM allows integration with multiple backends, making it easier to switch between models without modifying the core setup.\n- Maintenance & Scalability: A docker-compose.yml setup makes it easier to manage updates and ensure a more portable, reproducible environment.\n\n## Implementation Details (optional)\n- Add a docker-compose.yml file that:\n  - Defines all required services.\n  - Configures LiteLLM as the default backend.\n  - Uses environment variables for model selection and API configuration.\n- Remove the dependency on the installation script for deployment.\n- Ensure that LiteLLM is correctly configured to interact with the existing application workflow.\n\n## Additional context\n- The selected LLM model and API key would be configurable through environment variables (.env file).\n- This change aligns with best practices for containerized deployments, reducing manual intervention.\n- The transition from Ollama to LiteLLM expands the range of supported models while maintaining performance and reliability.",

      "body": "## Describe the feature you'd like and why\nHave you ever looked into graph RAG with neo4j? Graph databases allow showing relationships which can make the information more accurate when an LLM is hitting the vector db. neo4j has a way to vectorize the nodes while maintaining the relationships. I wonder how possible it is to pull off in n8n, they do allow for custom code and python is one of the options, plus you could build a custom n8n image to pull in any python libraries needed. (I have an image for puppeteer for more accurate web crawling since it uses chrome to render js pages.) \n\n## User Impact\n¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ \nim sure someone would like it\n\n## Implementation Details (optional)\nNo idea with n8n and neo4j. The tricky part is loading the data since langchain is used in python in the examples I have seen. They have an experimental branch that allows for categorizing the data as it is loaded into the graph and its not a straight forward create/update on a row like the other db tools. i have seen a community n8n-nodes-neo4j node but not sure how extensive it is, it seemed new\n\n## Additional context\nthese were some jupyter notebooks from articles i had seen. most other people dont seem to load or read the data correctly.\nhttps://github.com/tomasonjo/blogs/blob/master/llm/llm_graph_transformer_in_depth.ipynb\nhttps://github.com/tomasonjo/blogs/blob/master/llm/enhancing_rag_with_graph.ipynb\n\nhttps://medium.com/data-science/building-knowledge-graphs-with-llm-graph-transformer-a91045c49b59\n\nhttps://blog.langchain.dev/enhancing-rag-based-applications-accuracy-by-constructing-and-leveraging-knowledge-graphs/",

I want to create it manually in the supabase.  Can anyone share the table info? need to know the columns name and type.  thanks.\n\nV3: trigger issue\nI try the n8n with V3 Local Agentic RAG AI Agent.  All 3 items in Credentials are set as green text shown \"connection tested successfully\".  Two tables \"document_metadata\" and \"document_rows\" are created in supabase (checked in localhost:8000 -> Table Editor). \n\n And turn the workflow to \"Active\". then click the \"Local File Trigger\".  Then goto the folder \"/home/user/local-ai-packaged/shared\", add a test.txt and put some text.  but nothing in the \"Output\". it take \"forever\"! I wait 20 mins and stop it.  Nothing in the output or in supabase.  \n\nI restart the Agent (\"docker compose.... down\", and \"python3 start_services.py --profile cpu\")\n\ntry again, it take another 20 minus and I stop it, the document_metadata updated but not others.  looks better and try. let it run and go to dinner.  Come back and still running.  I check the supabase.  3 records in Document_metadata. 0 record in document_rows. And 3 records in documents_pg.\n\nmore, everytime I copy a file into the shared folder. I go to the docker -> n8n -> exec to ls the folder. I can see the files immediately.\n\nmy question is:\nhow to troubleshoot the slow issue? the V2 is first, V3 is slow. need to use GPU or and wait to see which node is slow?\nwhat is the best way to clean the supabase and the shared folder? I may did it wrong and cause the issue.\n\nThanks\nwai\n\n\n\n\n",

Tool options are improving so while i used this for a while, i've seen another tool and wanted to implement it but wanted to add it without deleting/reinstalling the existing one. So here is my feature request:\n\n## Feaure Request\nIt would be so helpful for a new section to the readme file to add some instructions to add new product to existing toolset. For example, I've a few workflows which uses Supabase database, ollama etc. and I wanted to add a new product for example TestWebUI interface.\n\nI've tried to implement docker-compose.yml but there are some errors so I've decided to open this feature request. It could be very useful to add some instructions about how can we update code for adding a new container and tool inside of \"localai\" project (container group). \n\nBest regards. \n",

      "title": "[FEATURE] Request for Login Setup Enhancement in Flowise",
      "body": "## Describe the feature you'd like and why\nI propose enhancing the security of Flowise by implementing a login setup that restricts unauthorized access. Below are the detailed steps for configuring this feature using environment variables and Docker Compose. This enhancement would greatly benefit Flowise users who deploy their instances online.\n\n## User Impact\nImplementing a login setup in Flowise will significantly enhance security by ensuring that only authorized users can access the application. This feature is particularly beneficial for organizations and individuals who deploy Flowise in environments where sensitive data is handled or where unauthorized access could lead to data breaches or misuse. By restricting access through authentication, users can have greater confidence in the integrity and confidentiality of their workflows and data managed within Flowise.\n\n## Implementation Details (optional)\nSuggested Implementation Steps:\n1. Enable App-Level Authentication: Flowise supports app-level authorization, which restricts access to your instance using a username and password. This ensures that only authorized users can access your applications.\n\n2. Create or Update the .env File: In the project’s root directory (or within the Docker folder), create or update the .env file with the following content:\n\n# Authentication credentials for Flowise\nFLOWISE_USERNAME=your_username\nFLOWISE_PASSWORD=your_password\n\nReplace your_username and your_password with your desired credentials.\n\n3. Modify the Docker Compose File: Update the docker-compose.yml file to reference these environment variables. Ensure the environment section of your Flowise service includes:\n\nflowise:\n    image: flowiseai/flowise\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    container_name: flowise\n    environment:\n        - PORT=3001\n        - FLOWISE_USERNAME=${FLOWISE_USERNAME}\n        - FLOWISE_PASSWORD=${FLOWISE_PASSWORD}\n    ports:\n        - 3001:3001\n    extra_hosts:\n        - \\\"host.docker.internal:host-gateway\\\"\n    volumes:\n        - ~/.flowise:/root/.flowise\n    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c \\\"sleep 3; flowise start\\\"\n\n4. Restart the Docker Services: After making these changes:\n# Stop all services\ndocker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f supabase/docker/docker-compose.yml down\n\n# Pull latest versions of all containers\ndocker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f supabase/docker/docker-compose.yml pull\n\n# Start services again with your desired profile\npython3 start_services.py --profile <your-profile>\n\n\n## Additional context\nBenefits:\nImplementing this setup will enhance the security of Flowise instances by restricting access to authorized users. It is particularly useful for deployments on public or shared servers.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dac60da-82c4-4f43-8ad0-223df7d2bd5c)",

Use `psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres` in command line to connect to Supabase's PostgreSQL database.\n2. You will get 'psql: error: connection to server at \"localhost\" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  Tenant or user not found'\n3. Use `psql -h 172.19.0.4 -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres` which 172.19.0.4 is the ip of the container, you will get psql: error: connection to server at \"172.19.0.4\", port 5432 failed: Connection timed out (0x0000274C/10060)\n\n## Expected Behavior\npsql: error: connection to server at \"172.19.0.4\", port 5432 failed: Connection timed out (0x0000274C/10060))\nor\npsql: error: connection to server at \"localhost\" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  Tenant or user not found\n\n## Actual Behavior\nConnection fail.

When I update a local file, previous entries are removed as expected, but the updated content gets added more than once.\n\nHere’s what happens:\n1. Updating a local file removes existing entries.\n2. The updated file is then added to Supabase DB multiple times instead of only once.\n\nThis issue can be seen in the attached image which shows the Supabase DB documents table.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- Existing records should be removed and the new content should be added once, without duplication.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n- Entries are correctly removed on the first run but the updated content/entries get duplicated on subsequent runs.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Update a local file in n8n.\n2. Observe that previous entries are removed and new ones are added, but they appear more than once.\n\n**Attachments:**\n- ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bf17840-af97-4391-b817-6619b21933de)\n- ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc3fd9e-c99b-40d5-97d4-c55acdc2ed5d)",

Something like\n`  network: \"local-ai`\n\n## Describe why\n\nThis would permit setting up a docker network before launching this project, and then launching another project that uses the same named network. Therefore not ever service needs to be exposed to be used by external containers\n\n## User Impact Who would benefit from this feature and how?\n\nI have another feature request coming to add services and this would have made it easier to setup sharing the services like ollama without having to expose them beyond the local machine.\n\n## Implementation Details (optional)\nAny thoughts on how this might be implemented?\n\nhttps://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/networking/#specify-custom-networks\n",

Postgres hooked up fine, from the .env, but I don't know the Supabase URL to configure those credentials. And there is not a step in the setup talking about that\n4. openwebui has these 4 in workspace, Models, prompts, Knowledge, Tools... no \"functions\" I tried to import it as a tool, but I get an error.\n5. Google Docs, I dont even see where to configure Google Docs in the n8n workflow.

According to code analysis, this problem may be caused by incomplete Docker network cleanup. I suggest adding a more powerful network cleanup mechanism to the existing cleanup logic to ensure that all related Docker network resources are completely cleaned up before starting the service, and increase the appropriate waiting time.\n\nThe following start_services.py file modifies the clean_docker_environment function to add a more powerful network cleanup mechanism, including forcibly removing all related Docker network resources and increasing the waiting time. Please adopt it.\n\nstart_services.py\n\n+ 46 - 9\n\nReview\n\nI have completed the fix for the Docker network error problem. The main improvements include:\n\n1. Enhanced the network cleanup mechanism of the clean_docker_environment function:\n\n- Added forced removal of all localai related Docker networks\n- Increased the waiting time for network cleanup\n- Improved error handling and log output\n2. Specific improvements include:\n\n- Use the docker network ls command to list all related networks\n- Use docker network rm -f to forcefully delete each network\n- Added an error handling mechanism for network cleanup\n- Increased the waiting time after cleanup to 10 seconds\nThese improvements should be able to solve the problem of incomplete network resource cleanup and avoid the occurrence of \"network not found\" errors.\n\nRevised code content as follows:\n`#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\nstart_services.py\n\nThis script starts the Supabase stack first, waits for it to initialize, and then starts\nthe local AI stack.
