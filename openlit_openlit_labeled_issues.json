      "body": "When I use the standard client.chat.completions.create call, OpenLit correctly generates trace logs, including telemetry details and spans:\n\n```\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport openlit\n\nopenlit.init()\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=\"\")\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23\"}\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nThis produces detailed trace logs with OpenLit (e.g., trace_id, gen_ai.request.model, etc.).\n\n\nHowever, when I switch to the structured output using client.beta.chat.completions.parse, trace logs are not generated:\n\n\n```\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport openlit\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nopenlit.init()\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=\"\")\n\nclass Step(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    output: str\n\nclass MathReasoning(BaseModel):\n    steps: list[Step]\n    final_answer: str\n\ncompletion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful math tutor.

Should OpenLit currently support tracing for structured output calls via .parse()? If not, is support planned?\n",

      "body": "### 🚀 What's the Problem?\nCurrently, there are several issues in the codebase:\n1. Duplicate code across different integrations, especially in telemetry and monitoring logic\n2. Inconsistent code style and patterns across different integrations\n3. Heavy reliance on events API which adds complexity and potential points of failure\n4. Lack of standardization in how integrations handle common operations like error handling, metrics collection, and tracing\n\n### 💡 Your Dream Solution\nA streamlined, maintainable codebase where:\n1. Common functionality is centralized in shared utilities\n2. All integrations follow consistent patterns and code styles\n3. Events API is replaced with direct OpenTelemetry instrumentation\n4. Each integration has:\n   - Clear, consistent docstrings\n   - Standardized error handling\n   - Unified approach to metrics and tracing\n   - Similar structure for wrapper functions\n   - Common utility functions for shared operations\n\n### 🤔 Seen anything similar?\n1. Current `utils.py` pattern in Pydantic AI integration that centralizes common functionality\n2. OpenTelemetry's own instrumentation patterns for different services\n3. LangChain's approach to standardizing integrations through base classes and mixins\n4. LiteLLM's unified interface for different LLM providers\n\n### 👐 Want to Help Make It Happen?\n- [x] Yes, I'd like to volunteer and help out with this!\n\n\n# OpenLit Integrations Checklist\n\n## LLM Providers\n- [ ] OpenAI\n- [ ] Anthropic\n- [ ] Cohere\n- [ ] Mistral\n- [ ] Bedrock\n- [ ] Vertex AI\n- [ ] Groq\n- [ ] Ollama\n- [ ] GPT4All\n- [ ] ElevenLabs\n- [ ] Reka\n- [ ] PremAI\n- [ ] AssemblyAI\n- [ ] Azure AI Inference\n- [ ] Together\n- [ ] AI21\n- [x] VLLM\n- [x] Google AI Studio\n\n## Vector Stores & Databases\n- [ ] Chroma\n- [ ] Pinecone\n- [ ] Qdrant\n- [ ] Milvus\n- [ ] Astra\n- [ ] Mem0\n\n## Frameworks & Tools\n- [ ] LangChain\n- [ ] LlamaIndex\n- [ ] Haystack\n- [ ] EmbedChain\n- [ ] Transformers\n- [ ] LiteLLM\n- [ ] CrewAI\n- [ ] AG2\n- [ ] Multion\n- [ ] Dynamiq\n- [ ] Phidata\n- [ ] Julep\n- [ ] ControlFlow\n- [ ] Crawl4AI\n- [ ] Firecrawl\n- [ ] Letta\n- [ ] Pydantic AI\n- [ ] OpenAI Agents\n\n## Infrastructure\n- [ ] GPU\n",

      "body": "### 🚀 What's the Problem?\nWe’re trying to use the Evaluations feature with models running locally via Ollama; however, OpenLit currently doesn’t allow configuring a custom API endpoint or supporting different API formats for connecting to on-premise models. The system seems to only support the public OpenAI API format, which prevents integration with local solutions like Ollama. As a result, we’re unable to run evaluations using our internally hosted models.\n\n\n### 💡 Your Dream Solution\nIdeally, we would like to configure:\n\n- A custom API endpoint URL to connect to the Ollama API (e.g. http://localhost:11434 or an internal network endpoint).\n\n- Optional fields to specify the model name and any additional generation parameters (such as temperature, top_p, etc.).\n\n- Full support for the request/response format used by the Ollama API, so evaluations can be performed locally just like they would with the OpenAI API.\n\n- A toggle/flag to indicate the evaluation backend is on-premise, to better support hybrid environments.\n\nThis added flexibility would greatly enhance the power of the OpenLit platform and allow teams with strict data privacy or custom model requirements to fully utilize the Evaluations feature.\n\n\n### 🤔 Seen anything similar?\nWe've also seen similar feature requests for Azure OpenAI support, which point to a broader need for customizable backends.\n\n\n### 🖼️ Pictures or Drawings\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44ec127d-c02a-47fb-a181-f64964d7c4e1)\n",

Although OpenLit is initialized correctly, no telemetry is being emitted — neither metrics like token usage or latency, nor traces for the model call.\n\n🕵️ Steps to Reproduce\nSet up a collector (e.g. Tempo) listening for OTLP HTTP.\n\nRun the following Python script:\n```python\nimport os\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nimport openlit\n\n# Initialize openlit\nopenlit.init(\n    environment=\"openlit-testing\",\n    application_name=\"openlit-python-test\",\n    otlp_endpoint=os.getenv(\"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\", \"http://collector:4318\"),\n    disable_batch=True  # For immediate dispatch in demo\n)\n\ndef main():\n    api_key = os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n    if not api_key:\n        raise ValueError(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable not set\")\n    \n    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)\n    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')\n  \n    response = model.generate_content(\"Explain the difference between a cat and a dog\")\n    \n    print(f\"Response: {response.text}\")\n    print(\"FINAL RESPONSE\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nObserve that no traces or metrics appear in your collector.\n\n🎯 What Did You Expect?\nI expected OpenLit to automatically capture and eport to otel traces and metrics of the LLM call; such as latency and token usage-\n\n📸 Any Screenshots?\nNo screenshots available — issue is in missing telemetry data.\n\n💻 Your Setup\n\nOpenLIT SDK Version: 1.33.19\n\nDeployment Method: Docker\n\n📝 Additional Notes\nLet me know if Gemini support is planned or requires special integration/configuration.

      "body": "🐛 What's Going Wrong?\n\nThe Grafana dashboards published on the official OpenLIT documentation are broken. When imported into Grafana (either on-prem or via Grafana Cloud), the panels display \"No data\" because they reference metric names that don't exist.\n\nFor example, the dashboard expects:\n\n    gen_ai_total_requests\n\n    gen_ai_usage_cost_sum\n\n    gen_ai_usage_total_tokens\n\nBut OpenLIT actually exposes:\n\n    gen_ai_requests_total\n\n    gen_ai_usage_cost_USD_bucket\n\n    gen_ai_client_token_usage_bucket\n\nThis results in all panels being empty.\n\n🕵️ Steps to Reproduce\n\n    1. Go to:\n\n        https://docs.openlit.io/latest/connections/prometheus-tempo\n\n        https://docs.openlit.io/latest/connections/grafanacloud\n\n    2. Download/import the provided Grafana dashboard JSON.\n\n    3. Load it into Grafana (tested both on-premise and cloud).\n\n    4. Observe that all panels show \"No data\".\n\n🎯 What Did You Expect?\n\nI expected the dashboard to correctly visualize OpenLIT metrics and display relevant data. The metric names in the dashboard should match those actually emitted by OpenLIT.\n\n📸 Any Screenshots?\n\nAttached screenshots show the dashboard panels with \"No data\" and the mismatched metric names.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cb43c81-81e0-406d-a2f6-12b11fe1ea21)\n\n💻 Your Setup\n\n    OpenLIT SDK Version: [e.g., 0.0.3]\n    Deployment Method: Helm\n    Grafana: On-Premise\n    Prometheus + Tempo used for metrics and traces\n\n📝 Additional Notes\n\n    The issue may be partially related to differences in how Grafana Cloud regions handle OpenTelemetry attributes, but I’m encountering this on-premise as well.\n\n    OpenLIT appears to send metrics in OTel format correctly; it's the dashboard that seems outdated or misaligned.\n\n\n",

      "body": "### 🐛 What's Going Wrong?\n\nOllama instrumentation doesn't work when using direct symbol imports like `from ollama import chat`.\n\n\n### 🕵️ Steps to Reproduce\nCode to reproduce this issue:\n\n```\nfrom ollama import chat # import the func `chat` beforehand\n\nopenlit.init(\n    otlp_endpoint=\"http://127.0.0.1:4318\",\n    application_name=\"openai-openlit-instr\",\n)\n\n# Call the `chat()` function here as following\nstream_response = chat(\n        model=base_model,\n        messages=[\n            {\n                'role': 'user',\n                'content': 'Tell a joke about opentelemetry'\n            },\n        ],\n        stream=True\n    )\n\n```\n\n### 🎯 What Did You Expect?\n\nThe instrumentation works with traces and metrics sent to the endpoint.\n\n### 📸 Any Screenshots?\n\n\n### 💻 Your Setup\n- OpenLIT Version: latest \n- OpenLIT SDK Version: latest\n- Deployment Method: macOS Sonoma on Apple Silicon with Python 3.13.1\n\n### 📝 Additional Notes\n\n**Cause**\n\nLooking at `packages/sample-app/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/ollama/__init__.py`, the module exports a `chat` name which is simply an alias for `_client.chat`, established via `chat = _client.chat`. Since this assignment happens during the module's initialization, code using from ollama import chat effectively captures the current reference of `_client.chat` and binds it to the chat name in its own scope.\n\n```\n_client = Client()\n\ngenerate = _client.generate\nchat = _client.chat\nembed = _client.embed\n```\nLater modifications(applying wrappers for instrumentation) to the source method (Client.chat) do not propagate to these pre-existing imported references. The imported chat continues to point to the object it referenced at the time of import.\n\n**When does instrumentation take effect?**\nImporting the function in the following ways will allow the instrumentation to take effect.\n```\nimport ollama\n\nopenlit.init()\n\nollama.chat()\n```\nThe unit test case uses this, so it can be instrument successfully. And the another style is following.\n\n```\nopenlit.init()\n\nfrom ollama import chat\n\nchat()\n```\n\n### How to solve this\n\nMaybe in the instrumentation of ollama we can add a snippet of code which scan every loaded module and find any attribute named `chat` (or `generate`, `embeddings`, etc.) whose implementation lives in the ollama package, and replace it with our dynamic proxy. That proxy then delegates to the latest `ollama.chat` under the hood, so no matter how the user imported the function, their calls still get instrumented.\n\n### 👐 Want to Help Make It Happen?\n- [x] Yes, I'd like to volunteer and help out with this!\n",

Perhaps `SystemMessage.type` and `SystemMessage.text()` are what was intended to be called?\n\n### 🕵️ Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate any LangChain application, and add OpenLIT.\n\n### 🎯 What Did You Expect?\n\nThe bug not to happen.\n\n### 💻 Your Setup\n- OpenLIT Version: 1.33.14\n\n### 📝 Additional Notes\n\nI had first mentioned this error in a [comment in a different issue](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/issues/635#issuecomment-2698769956), for a different version of the library.

      "body": "### 🐛 What's Going Wrong?\nI recently tried to install OpenLIT SDK in my Node.js application using `ts-node`, but I encountered the following error:\n\n```sh\n2025-02-13 19:13:20 import { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources';\n2025-02-13 19:13:20 ^^^^^^\n2025-02-13 19:13:20 SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module\n```\n\nIt seems that OpenLIT SDK (`/app/node_modules/openlit/src/index.ts`) is using ES module syntax. However, my project is configured with `\"module\": \"commonjs\"` in `tsconfig.json`, causing a compatibility issue.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set up a Node.js application with TypeScript.\n2. Install `openlit` using:\n\n   ```sh\n   npm install openlit\n   ```\n3. Ensure `tsconfig.json` contains:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"module\": \"commonjs\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Call `Openlit.init()` in `index.js`:\n\n   ```sh\n   Openlit.init();\n   ```\n\n5. Run the application using `ts-node`:\n\n   ```sh\n   npx ts-node index.ts\n   ```\n6. Observe the **SyntaxError**.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 What Did You Expect?\nI expected OpenLIT to work seamlessly in a CommonJS project without module-related issues.\n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ Any Screenshots?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0808240c-5bf6-4ad0-8d6b-aec4f49abd88)\n\n---\n\n### 💻 Your Setup\n- **OpenLIT SDK Version:** ^1.3.1\n\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Additional Notes\nTo ensure compatibility with both CommonJS and ES modules, OpenLIT could provide separate builds in its package:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"main\": \"dist/index.cjs.js\", // CommonJS build\n  \"module\": \"dist/index.esm.js\" // ES Module build\n}\n```\n\nWould it be possible to update OpenLIT to support both module systems?\n\n---\n\n### 👐 Want to Help Make It Happen?\n- [ ] Yes, I'd like to volunteer and help out with this!\n",

      "title": "[Bug]: Error when Tracing bedrock.converse with Image Message",
      "body": "### 🐛 What's Going Wrong?\r\nIn the `bedrock` instrumentor, attempting to trace a `converse` function containing an image message triggers an error. The issue occurs at this [line](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/blob/0c41338bb53e20a3a4aa956769645146f3b504c6/sdk/python/src/openlit/instrumentation/bedrock/bedrock.py#L108), where the code tries to access `item[\"text\"]` in message content. According to the [`converse`](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-runtime/client/converse.html) specification, content items do not contain a `type` key, causing a `KeyError` when the item is an image without a `text` key.\r\n\r\n### 🕵️ Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Call the `converse` function with a `messages` payload that includes both text and image content:\r\n    ```python\r\n    response = client.converse(\r\n        modelId='string',\r\n        messages=[\r\n            {\r\n                'role': 'user',\r\n                'content': [\r\n                    {\"text\": \"What is in the image?\"},\r\n                    {\r\n                        'image': {\r\n                            'format': 'png',\r\n                            'source': {\r\n                                'bytes': b'bytes'\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    )\r\n    ```\r\n2. Observe that an error is raised due to the absence of a `type` key and the lack of a `text` key for the image item.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc416663-7559-4c9e-adbe-827dc9b8980d)\r\n\r\n### 🎯 What Did You Expect?\r\nI expected the `converse` function to handle non-text content items gracefully, logging only the text messages and ignoring items in byte format (e.g., images).\r\n\r\n### 💻 Your Setup\r\n- OpenLIT SDK Version: 1.29.3\r\n\r\n### 📝 Additional Notes\r\nProposed solution: Update the code to log only text messages, ensuring that items in byte format are excluded. Here’s a code snippet to address the issue:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncontent_str = \", \".join(f'text: {item[\"text\"]}' for item in content if \"text\" in item)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 👐 Want to Help Make It Happen?\r\n- [x] Yes, I'd like to volunteer and help out with this!\r\n",

If the image is large, the OTel exporter can fail with a 413 (Payload Too Large) error.\r\n2. Logging image bytes or base64 data doesn’t provide meaningful insights and can add unnecessary load.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Your Dream Solution\r\nIntroduce a configurable flag to disable logging of images, or modify the behavior to log only text messages by default. This would prevent large binary data from being sent to OTel and streamline the logging process.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Code Change:\r\n- Add a flag to control content logging behavior.\r\n- Or log only text messages:\r\n\r\nOriginal ([link to code](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/blob/0c41338bb53e20a3a4aa956769645146f3b504c6/sdk/python/src/openlit/instrumentation/openai/openai.py#L87)):\r\n```python\r\nif isinstance(content, list):\r\n    content_str = \", \".join(\r\n        f'{item[\"type\"]}: {item[\"text\"] if \"text\" in item else item[\"image_url\"]}'\r\n        if \"type\" in item else f'text: {item[\"text\"]}'\r\n        for item in content\r\n    )\r\n    formatted_messages.append(f\"{role}: {content_str}\")\r\nelse:\r\n    formatted_messages.append(f\"{role}: {content}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\n```python\r\nif isinstance(content, list):\r\n    content_str = \", \".join(\r\n        f'text: {item[\"text\"]}' for item in content if \"text\" in item\r\n    )\r\n    formatted_messages.append(f\"{role}: {content_str}\")\r\nelse:\r\n    formatted_messages.append(f\"{role}: {content}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis update would ensure that only text content is logged, preventing large, unnecessary data from being exported.\r\n",

      "body": "### 🐛 What's Going Wrong?\r\n>  There are a couple of issues with the Token Usage graph:\r\n- Value on Y axis does not correspond to the Max value (Total Tokens). This is because all 3 token usage values(prompt tokens, completion tokens and Total tokens) are stacked. Consequently Y axis displays a sum of all 3 stacked values. Ideally only 2 token usage values should be stacked and total tokens will be an implied value. in my screenshot , Y axis value is 56189. This value is determined by summing up Total tokens(28087), prompt tokens(18326) and completion tokens(9761) + 15.\r\n-  The token usage is not stacked in the proper order. Lowest value should be dynamically placed first. In my case Completion tokens should be first, followed by prompt tokens. Sum of these should imply/indicate Total tokens.\r\n\r\n### 🕵️ Steps to Reproduce\r\n- Instrument any LLM app with OpenLIT\r\n- Check the token usage graph\r\n\r\n### 🎯 What Did You Expect?\r\n> For issue 1 : Y axis value should be total tokens + 15 instead of total tokens + prompt tokens + completion tokens + 15\r\n> For issue 2: Lowest value (completion tokens) is placed at the bottom followed by the next higher value (prompt tokens).

Specifically, I am using the meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model from Hugging Face, and when passing this model through a transformers pipeline and into a HuggingFacePipeline, followed by a RAG chain, OpenLIT does not show token usage information on the dashboard.

It could be a good idea to introduce custom tags to enable monitoring by group. For example, my application manages many clients simultaneously, and all the cost monitoring metrics allow me to see the total cost spent by my application, but only per model (as my application uses several LLM models).\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to be able to define additional custom tags for the metrics, configurable via sdk. \r\nIn my case, I would add the client ID, so I could monitor costs for individual user (and total cost as well).\r\n",

      "title": "[Feat]: Adopt OTel Semantic Conventions for Resource Attributes",
      "body": "### 🚀 What's the Problem?\r\nThe application name and instrumentation library are currently included in each span and metric as attributes (`gen_ai.application_name`, `telemetry.sdk.name`), which is a non-standard strategy to name and deliver such information.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Your Dream Solution\r\nOpenTelemetry provides a `service.name` standard attribute to hold the application name. It's included in the resource attributes instead of span attributes. See: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service. It's actually present in the spans produced by OpenLit, but it's set to `default` rather than to the application name. About the metrics, having the `service.name` as a resource attribute instead of metric attribute is also the standard strategy. See: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/prometheus_and_openmetrics/#resource-attributes\r\n\r\nAbout the instrumentation library name (`telemetry.sdk.name`), it's currently included as a span attribute, as a resource attribute, and as a metric attribute. Is it required to have it as a span attribute and metric attribute? Would it work having it just as a resource attribute, as defined in the semantic conventions? See: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#telemetry-sdk. It's also required to provide `telemetry.sdk.language` and `telemetry.sdk.version` to fullfill the conventions.\r\n\r\n### 📖 Additional Context\r\nI really like OpenLit, congratulations on such a great library and thanks for following the OpenTelemetry path. It makes it possible to integrate even more systems with OpenLit. I'm currently working on integrating Java applications with OpenLit, and thanks to the OpenTelemetry adoption is more approachable.

When using the OpenLit library, that's not a problem since that is done as part of the instrumentation. However, when integrating other libraries/applications, it becomes a problem if they follow the OTel Trace specification and keep the `StatusCode` unset in successful scenarios.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Your Dream Solution\r\nIt would be great if the span `StatusCode=OK` requirement could be removed, perhaps converting that into a filter to exclude spans with an explicit `StatusCode=ERROR`. The OpenTelemetry Trace Specification ([spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.34.0/specification/trace/api.md#set-status)) includes the following about the status:\r\n\r\n> Generally, Instrumentation Libraries SHOULD NOT set the status code to Ok, unless explicitly configured to do so. Instrumentation Libraries SHOULD leave the status code as Unset unless there is an error, as described above.\r\n> \r\n> Application developers and Operators may set the status code to Ok.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the [OTel semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/#status) includes the following about the status of HTTP interactions: \r\n\r\n> [Span Status](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.33.0/specification/trace/api.md#set-status) MUST be left unset if HTTP status code was in the 1xx, 2xx or 3xx ranges, unless there was another error (e.g., network error receiving the response body; or 3xx codes with max redirects exceeded), in which case status MUST be set to Error.\r\n\r\n### 📖 Additional Context\r\nI really like OpenLit, congratulations on such a great library and thanks for following the OpenTelemetry path. It makes it possible to integrate even more systems with OpenLit. I'm currently working on integrating Java applications with OpenLit, and thanks to the OpenTelemetry adoption is more approachable.

      "body": "### 🐛 What's Going Wrong?\r\n\r\nI work on the OpenTelemetry LLM semantics SIG, and did an evaluation of the SDK based on the following sample code and what the semantics pending release 1.27.0 will define.\r\n\r\nThe sample code produces one span and five metrics.\r\n\r\nThe span has several exact matches with the pending semantics, but also numerous areas where data is collected as different attributes, different value types or different model locations (e.g. attribute where defined as an event). That said, many differences feel like linting vs major differences. \r\n\r\nThe metrics currently have little in common with what's pending release, either by accident or by intent of collecting different signals or collecting it differently.\r\n\r\n### 🕵️ Steps to Reproduce\r\nrun the following against an ollama hosted codegemma:2b-code model and look at the collector output.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nimport openlit\r\nfrom openai import OpenAI\r\n\r\n# Set the service name such that it is different from other experiments\r\napplication_name = \"openlit-python-ollama\"\r\n# Default the SDK endpoint ENV variable to localhost\r\notlp_endpoint = os.getenv(\"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\", \"http://localhost:4318\")\r\n# Don't batch spans, as this is a demo\r\nopenlit.init(application_name=application_name, otlp_endpoint=otlp_endpoint, disable_batch=True)\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    ollama_host = os.getenv('OLLAMA_HOST', 'localhost')\r\n    # Use the OpenAI endpoint, not the Ollama API.\r\n    base_url = 'http://' + ollama_host + ':11434/v1'\r\n    client = OpenAI(base_url=base_url, api_key='unused')\r\n    messages = [\r\n      {\r\n        'role': 'user',\r\n        'content': '<|fim_prefix|>def hello_world():<|fim_suffix|><|fim_middle|>',\r\n      },\r\n    ]\r\n    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(model='codegemma:2b-code', messages=messages)\r\n    print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 🎯 What Did You Expect?\r\n\r\nSemantic evaluation on [spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans.md).\r\n\r\ncompatible:\r\n* kind=client\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.system']='openai'\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.operation.name']='chat'\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.response.id']='chatcmpl-411'\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.request.model']='codegemma:2b-code'\r\n\r\ndeprecated fields:\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.usage.completion_tokens']=60 (deprecated for gen_ai.usage.output_tokens)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.usage.prompt_tokens']=24 (deprecated for gen_ai.usage.input_tokens)\r\n\r\nincompatible:\r\n* name='openai.chat.completions' (should be 'chat codegemma:2b-code')\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.request.top_p']=1 (should be a double 1.0, not int 1)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.request.max_tokens']='' (should be an int, not a string)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.request.temperature']=1 (should be a double 1.0, not int 1)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.request.presence_penalty']=0 (should be a double 0.0, not int 0)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.request.frequency_penalty']=0 (should be a double 0.0, not int 0)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.prompt']='<|fim_prefix|>def hello_world():<|fim_suffix|><|fim_middle|>'  (should be 'content' in the event attribute `gen_ai.prompt`)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.response.finish_reason']='stop' (should be 'gen_ai.response.finish_reasons' and an array)\r\n* attributes['gen_ai.completion']='...'

This step poses a challenge for users who may not be familiar with best practices for dashboard creation in Grafana, potentially leading to suboptimal monitoring setups.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Your Dream Solution\r\nThe ideal solution would be the development of a comprehensive monitoring mixin for Grafana Cloud tailored specifically for Doku's exported metrics.
